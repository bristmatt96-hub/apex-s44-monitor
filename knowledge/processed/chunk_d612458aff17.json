To express the theta in the more common form of daily decay, the resulting number must be divided by 365. The vega is expressed in terms of the sensitivity to a one-full-point (100-percent- age-point) change in volatility. To express the vega in the more common form of the sensitivity to a one-percentage-point change in volatility, the resulting number must be divided by 100. 3.

Darren Wilcox has suggested a variation on the Black Model where the underlying contract (U) is assumed to be normally distributed and may therefore take on negative values.4 C = e(U-E)N(h) + et N\u2019(hyvvt e-(U-E)N(h) + e*N(h)vvt - e-\"(U-E) m=) Ul where h = \u2014 Note: Since this variation assumes a normal, rather than lognormal, distribution, the volatility, v, is the standard deviation of absolute price changes, rather than the standard deviation of logarithmic price changes. The only difficulty in using the Black-Scholes Model or its variations is the calculation of N(x), the cumulative normal density function. Values for N(x) can be found in most statistical tables. Alternatively, the following approximation is suitable for most practical applications: If x 2 0, then N(x) = 1 \u2014 N\u2019(x)(.4361836k \u2014 .1201676k? + .9372980k3} where k = 1/(1 + .33267 1x1) and N\u2019(x} is the normal distribution curve previously described. If x < 0, then N(x) = 1 -\u2014 N(x) Il, The Cox-Ross-Rubenstein (Binomial) Model\u201d The Cox-Ross-Rubenstein Model makes the assumption that over any period of time the underlying contract can move up (u) or down (d) by a given amount. The probability of an up move is given by p, and the probability of a down move is given by 1 \u2014p. For example, suppose a certain contract is trading at 100, and over the next time period the contract will move up to 105 (u=5) or down to 95 (d=\u20145), and that there is a 50 percent chance (p=.5) of either outcome. If this is the only time period remaining to expiration, and there are no interest considerations, we can calculate the value of a 100 call as its expected return at the end the period. The call is worth intrinsic value if the underlying contract is above the exercise price, and zero if the underlying contract is below the exercise price. Its expected return is: 9 X (105 - 100) + 0 = 2.50 4. \u2014 Wilcox, Darren, \u201cSpread Options in Energy Markets\u201d, Research Paper, Goldman, Sachs & Co., March 1990. 5. Cox, John C.; Ross, Stephen A.; and Rubenstein, Mark; \u201cOption Pricing: A Simplified Approach\u201d; Journal of Financial Economics, No. 7, 1979; pages 229-263 For a good discussion of the computation required, see: Meisner, James E. and Labuszewski, John W.; \u201cThe Cox-Ross-Rubenstein Model for Alternative Underlying Instruments\u201d; Advances in Futures and Options Research; Vol. 2, 1987; pages 263-278 The Mathematics of Option Pricing 435 In the same way we can calculate the value of a 90 call as: 5 x (105 - 90) + .5 x (95 \u2014 90) = 10 We can extend this approach by dividing the time to expiration into many small periods, and assume that over each period the underlying contract will always move up (u) or down (d). The result at expiration will be a binomial tree, with many possible prices at expiration for the underlying contract. An example of a three-period binomial tree is shown in Figure B-1. If we assume that the probability, p, of an up move and the probability, 1-p, of a down move, is the same at each node of the binomial tree, it is a simple matter to calculate the probability of each price outcome at expiration. The expected return for the option is the sum, for each outcome where the option is in-the-money, of the difference between the option\u2019s exercise price and the underlying price, multiplied by the probability of that outcome. All outcomes where the option is out-of-the-money are set to zero. In order to create a binomial tree which will approximate a lognormal distribution we can define the following: u = evn d= 1/u where n = the number of periods to expiration (the number of branches on the binomial tree) Figure B-1 A 3 Period Binomial Tree u= +5 145 (100 call = 15) d=",
