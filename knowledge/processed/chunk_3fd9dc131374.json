FIGURE 10.30 A Successful Sell Anti P1: OTA JWBT634-c10 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 8:1 Printer: Hamilton Printing Trade Examples: The Anti 329 D: Though the stock recovered to close above the midpoint of the session, this strong down day in Figure 10.30 is con\ufb01rmation that the balance of power has shifted, and should add con\ufb01dence to the trade. Note also that, depending on the exact location of the entry and the stop, the \ufb01rst target may have been hit on this \ufb01rst downward bar. Do not expect that every one of these will be a clean trade with no retracements. In this case, there were multiple small pauses as the market traded lower. Maintain the discipline of pro\ufb01t taking, and avoid the temptation to add to the trade unless another pattern, such as a nested pullback, sets up. In this case, the small failure test at E might have been motivation to exit any remaining short exposure. Anti 2 FIGURE 10.31 A Sell Anti in Baidu Inc.

B: In this case, a single large bar completely shifted the technical picture. This bar was out of character with the recent price action and carried price well through the moving average. Note that the MACD registered a signi\ufb01cant new low, rela- tive to its recent history, on this thrust. Entry C: The actual entry would have been somewhere around C or the bars following, executing the plan of shorting intraday breakdowns or perhaps simply shorting below the previous day\u2019s low. Stop Only the near stop is shown in this example, though a much farther stop, above the extreme of the trend high, is also possible.FIGURE 10.32 A Clean, Sharp Breakdown out of a Sell Anti P1: OTA JWBT634-c10 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 8:1 Printer: Hamilton Printing Trade Examples: The Anti 331 D: Whether this bar in Figure 10.32 or a preceding bar was the entry, the initial target was probably hit on the bar following D. Book partial pro\ufb01ts here, and lower the stop to reduce open risk in the trade. E: Remember, the swing trader\u2019s job is to take one clean move out of the market. Though there was more downside over the next four to six weeks, most swing traders would have covered their position on the sharp reversal at E. F: This is essentially a higher time frame pullback and is not strictly part of the Anti trade, though it is an example of how a lower time frame structure (the Anti) can set up an environment that is favorable to a larger pattern. Anti 3 FIGURE 10.33 A Buy Anti Setup in the EURUSD Setup A: This downtrend in Figure 10.33 was perhaps not as dramatically overextended as the uptrends in the previous examples, but multiple tests below the lower band, followed by a last-gasp sell-off that quickly failed, were warnings of a possible overextension and of a trend that was primed for reversal.

P1: OTA JWBT634-c10 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 8:1 Printer: Hamilton Printing 332 TRADING STRATEGIES B: The bounce at B is out of character with the preceding price movement. The up- swing was longer than previous upswings, both in price and in time, and the MACD con\ufb01rms with a new high. Entry C: This is a small complex consolidation (two legs down, separated by a failed rally attempt) nested inside an Anti. An Anti is, in fact, basically a pullback\u2014the distinguishing feature is its location in the trend. An entry could have been at- tempted near the right edge of the chart, against a stop somewhere above 1.20. FIGURE 10.34 A Strong Uptrend Develops o\ufb00 the Buy Anti D: You have to pay attention with these entry setups, and cannot always wait until the end of the bar. In this case, if you missed the early entry on the previous day\u2019s breakout, it might have made sense to pass on the trade, rather than entering after such a large up day as D in Figure 10.34. However, this is a case in which the statistical tendencies for different asset classes matter. An individual stock or stock index might have been more set for a small reversal following day like D, but currencies do not show this tendency.

Many traders will treat an entry like this as an entirely separate trade, perhaps continuing to hold",
