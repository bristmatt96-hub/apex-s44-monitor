These indica- tors could provide entries for mean-reversion trades, but careful testing is needed. pairs strategies A term usually reserved for spread trades between different stocks. See spread trading. paper trading A tool sometimes used by developing traders that involves placing trades in a simulated environment. (The term does not imply literal use of pencil and paper.) Paper trading has limited utility because it cannot replicate the psychological challenges of having money at risk. Parabolic SAR A trading system originally developed by Welles Wilder that was designed to always be in the market, reversing long or short according to signals generated from price movements. (SAR stands for stop and reverse.) path-dependent Refers to a scenario that can have different values or outcomes depend- ing on decisions or outcomes at different steps in the process. pay the offer A term that means to buy an asset directly at the offered price, without attempting to bid for a lower (better) price. Market orders should equivalently pay the offer, but there is the danger of large and uncontrolled slippage. per-unit risk The difference between the entry and exit price on a trade, or the risk to be taken on one unit (share, contract, etc.) of the instrument. pivot high or pivot low See \ufb01rst-order pivot. pivot points See \ufb01rst-order pivot. point and \ufb01gure charts A charting technique, mostly obsolete, that charts reversals from pivot points. The x-axis is not scaled for any \ufb01xed unit; rather, it moves forward when the speci\ufb01ed reversal from the pivot has occurred. This was a technique historically used by \ufb02oor traders that still \ufb01nds some applications in computerized trading. population In statistical testing, usually considered to be the set of all possible events or items with the characteristic being studied. The population is usually unseen and un- knowable, so the central problem of inferential statistics is to try to understand the char- acteristics of the population based on samples taken from that population. positive expectancy See expectancy or expected value . A positive expected value sug- gests that a trader is likely to make a pro\ufb01t over a large enough sample size of trades, provided there is good execution and the expected value is larger than transaction costs. post hoc From the Latin term meaning \u201cafter this.\u201d Refers to events usually de\ufb01ned after the analysis or experiment is concluded. preceding trend leg In the impulse/consolidation/impulse framework, this is the initial trend leg that sets up the consolidation. price action A term that refers to a formalized understanding of how prices move. Price action is usually most visible on lower time frames, and price action creates market struc- ture. In the terminology of a certain subset of retail traders, \u201cprice action trading\u201d refers to trading without any indicators or moving averages, but this is mostly a meaningless distinction. 186 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

The absence of price rejection suggests a higher probability of the level breaking. pro\ufb01t target Some technical systems set pro\ufb01t targets for part or all of the position. In general, traders using systems like this should develop the discipline of entering their pro\ufb01t-taking orders as soon as the trade is initiated. proper pyramids Pyramids that start with the largest number of units they will ever have at a level. These strategies can usually endure volatility at the end of a trend much better than reverse pyramids. pullback A general term for a consolidation pattern in a trend. Many of the traditional distinctions of technical analysis (\ufb02ag, pennant, box, etc.) are not meaningful, as all pull- back patterns can be traded according to similar rules. pyramiding plans Plans for adding additional units to a trade once the trade has moved a speci\ufb01c distance into pro\ufb01t. random walk hypothesis (RWH) A theory that says that asset prices can be described by random walks. Various forms and dimensions of random walks exist. In practice, the RWH seems to hold reasonably well for some assets and some time frames. range The high-low of a bar or trading session. range expansion A term to indicate more directional movement in markets. A market undergoing a range expansion phase will probably trend in one direction, the range of bars will probably expand, and measures of volatility will increase on some time frames. real trend line (RTL) A technique for drawing a trend line that marks the important in\ufb02ections in trends, usually best-suited to application on longer time frames. relative strength A term used to describe relative price movements between markets. Skilled traders and analysts can \ufb01nd clues to institutional conviction and large-scale money \ufb02ows in relative strength. Relative Strength Index (RSI) A technical indicator that seeks to identify overbought or oversold markets by measuring the relative distribution of up and down closes. Note that it does not measure relative strength, nor is it an index. resistance A term attached to price areas that may provide a barrier to advancing prices, or areas where suf\ufb01cient supply may exist to stop prices. resistive force See motive force. retracement Another general term for consolidation, pullback, or a",
