Unfortunately, most stock price series are not stationary\u2014they exhibit a geometric random walk that gets them farther and farther away from their starting (i.e., initial public offering) values. However, you can often find a pair of stocks such that if you long one and short the other, the market value of the pair is stationary. If this is the case, then the two indi- vidual time series are said to be cointegrated. They are so described because a linear combination of them is integrated of order zero. Typically, two stocks that form a cointegrating pair are from the same industry group. Traders have long been familiar with this so- called pair-trading strategy. They buy the pair portfolio when the spread of the stock prices formed by these pairs is low, and sell/ short the pair when the spread is high\u2014in other words, a classic mean-reverting strategy.

A stationary series is an excellent candidate for a mean-reverting strategy. This exam- ple teaches you how to use a free MATLAB package, downloadable at An example of a pair of cointegrating price series is the gold ETF GLD versus the gold miners ETF, GDX, which I discussed in Example 3.6. If we form a portfolio with long 1 share of GLD and short 1.631 share of GDX, the prices of the portfolio form a stationary time series (see Figure 7.2). The exact number of shares of GLD and GDX can be determined by a regression fit of the two component time series (see Example 7.2). Note that just like Example 3.6, I have used only the first 252 data points as the training set for this regression.

The main method used to test for cointegration is called the coin- tegrating augmented Dickey-Fuller test, hence the function name cadf. A detailed description of this method can be found in the manual, also available on the same website mentioned earlier.
