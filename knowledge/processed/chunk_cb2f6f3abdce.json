While elementary strategies such as the ones discussed in this chapter are a convenient method of introducing the new trader to basic option characteristics, in actual practice it is very unlikely that a trader will put on a position and let it go to expiration. Even if he were to initiate a position with such an intent, he would be foolish indeed to simply walk away from the position and come back at expiration to find out whether he had made or lost money. As market conditions change, a position which seemed sensible yesterday may not seem quite so sensible today. Based on new conditions the trader may want to\u2014indeed, may have to\u2014alter his strategy. This is true for all traders, not just for option traders. A trader who buys stock in the belief that it will rise would be foolish not to reassess his position if the stock were to unexpectedly drop several points. An option trader who sells 105 calls in the belief that the underlying contract will never rise above 105 would likewise be foolish not to reassess the situation if the underlying contract were to make a rapid upward move from 99 to 104. He may Still believe that the underlying contract will not rise above 105, but he is unlikely to have the same degree of confidence. Every trader reserves the right to make a more intelligent decision today than he made yesterday. The serious trader must be able to identify potentially profitable strategies given current market conditions. But he must also be able to adjust to changing market conditions and to take protective measures when the market moves adversely. In the next chapter we will begin our investigation of basic option pricing theory, and show how this theory can be used to help a trader achieve these goals. _\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2.
