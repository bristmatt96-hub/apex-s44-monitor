Bars and Candles Once we start aggregating trades on the x-axis, a graphical device is needed to explain the activity in that space. One logical solution is simply to plot a vertical bar, with the top and bottom of the bar representing the high and low extremes reached during the period (right panel in Figure A.3). Traders often \ufb01nd it useful to mark the \ufb01rst trade of the period with a tick on the left side of the bar (the open) and the last trade of the period with a tick on the right side (the close). These four data points, plotted like this, create the classical bar chart. An alternate format is the candlestick chart, which prints a wide body between the open and close of the bars, with thinner shadows (also called \u201ctails\u201d or \u201cwicks\u201d) above and below the body, reaching to the high and low of the period (left panel in Figure A.3). Candlestick charts were \ufb01rst used in medieval Japan for rice trading, so much of the terminology associated with patterns of candles is also Japanese. Traditionally, the body of the candle is \ufb01lled in if the close is lower than the open and left empty if the close is 349.00 349.00 9:40 9:50 10:00 9:40 9:50 10:00 156 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Modern charting software packages usually \ufb01ll the body of every candle but change the color to something intuitive like red for downward-closing candles and green or blue for upward-closing candles. Time Charts and Other Options Though the strength of tick charts is their ability to adapt to activity levels in the markets, traders and analysts often prefer a format where each bar corresponds to a predictable unit of time. These time charts are by far the most commonly used in most applications, and are especially useful for traders looking at daily and longer time frames. The chart is referred to by the length of each time unit (as in a 5-minute chart), which may also be called the time frame of the chart. Many traders choose to look at different time frames (for instance, 5-minute, hourly, and daily charts) for the same market to get a better sense of the forces affecting prices at any time. There are other possibilities for scaling the x-axis, but these tend to be less used except in certain speci\ufb01c contexts. It is possible to aggregate bars not by ticks (trans- actions) but by trading volume. In this case, a bar would contain a certain number of FIGURE A.4 Market Pro\ufb01le Chart of AAPL AAPI. - Oaiy Apple Inc 360.00 358.00 356.00 354.00 352.00 350.00 348.00 346.00 344.00 342.00 340.00 338.00 r 336.00 334.00 Jul 5 6 7 8 11 157 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Another possibility is to have each bar end after a certain range is reached, so that, for instance, each bar would be 0.25 wide. (Be aware that the range bars created at the end of a trading day will be dif- ferent from the ones created as the market unfolds. This makes backtesting and analysis on range bars virtually impossible.) Other types of charts include swing charts, point and \ufb01gure charts, kagi charts, line charts, and many others, but these are much less common and are outside the scope of this primer, with one exception. One other chart worth mentioning is Market Pro\ufb01le, cre- ated by Peter Steidlmayer in the 1980s. Market Pro\ufb01le charts essentially allow the trader to look inside the bar to see where most volume and trading activity occurred in the time period. Market Pro\ufb01le displays this information in a graphical format attached to the right of each bar, with wider horizontal bars indicating more trading activity at that price level. (See Figure A.4.) While most charting methods only reprocess the same open, high, low, and close (OHLC), volume, and open interest information, Market Pro\ufb01le is an important innovation\u2014it adds detail and perspective that is not visible on a standard chart. 158 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Too many times, traders use indicators or tools on their charts that they do not understand. Rules are developed based on the action of a squiggly line without fully understanding what that line measures and represents. Though some traders will \ufb01nd some success with an",
