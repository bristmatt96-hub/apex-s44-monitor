Many people believe that price changes are random and un- predictable; if this were true, the only logical course of action would be to avoid trading and to invest in index funds. This is, in fact, what a signi\ufb01cant number of \ufb01nancial ad- visers recommend their clients do. On the other hand, there are analysts and traders who believe that they have some edge over the market, that there is some predictability in prices. This camp divides into two groups that historically have been diametrically opposed: those who make decisions based on fundamental factors and those who rely on technical factors. Fundamental analysts and traders make decisions based on their assessment of value, through an analysis of a number of factors such as \ufb01nancial state- ments, economic conditions, and an understanding of supply/demand factors. Techni- cal traders and analysts make decisions based on information contained in past price changes themselves. Our work here concerns the latter approach. Few traders make decisions in a vac- uum; technical traders may consider fundamental factors, and fundamental traders may \ufb01nd that their entries and exits into markets can be better timed with an understand- ing of the relevant elements of market structure, money \ufb02ows, and price action. Most traders \ufb01nd success with a hybrid approach that incorporates elements from many disci- plines, and there are very few purely technical or fundamental decision makers. The key distinction, for us, is that technically motivated traders acknowledge the primacy of price itself. They know that price represents the end product of the analysis and decision 3 2 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Though these \ufb01rst-order pivots do sometimes coincide with major turning points in the market, they are so common that they cannot be extremely signi\ufb01cant. Every major turning point, by de\ufb01nition, comes at a pivot, so it is easy to overstate their importance; once you see a chart with every possible pivot marked, it becomes obvious that this structure is so common that it is nearly insigni\ufb01cant. It is also interesting to consider that most pivots on one time frame mark signi\ufb01cant market structures on lower time frames, but this is a complication that we will save for later. As a stand-alone concept, \ufb01rst-order pivot highs and lows have limited utility; their power comes from their relationship to other pivots and their ability to de\ufb01ne market structure. They are like a single brick in a building\u2014not that interesting or useful by itself. Second-order pivot highs (also called intermediate-term pivots) are \ufb01rst-order pivot highs that are preceded and followed by lower \ufb01rst-order pivot highs; again,",
