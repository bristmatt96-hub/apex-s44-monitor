W e are lookin g to ferret out instances w h ere we a l most unconscious l y sa b otage our b etter interests b y min dl ess l y l istening to w h at our min d s are te ll ing us. Again, we aren \u2019t l oo k ing to engage in a tug\u2010o f \u2010war with our mind; we simply want to be aware of our self\u2010talk, recall what is most im - portant to us, an d ma k e room f or w h atever d isagreea bl e t h oug h ts an d f ee l ings arise as we turn our attention to t h e tas k s we k now h ave h ig h va l ue an d are important over t h e l ong h au l , suc h as reviewing our tra d es f or t h e d ay, k eeping our tra d ing journa l , or preparin g for the next day\u2019s tradin g . Acceptin g a little privation or facin g a little di ffi culty in the service of your trading is associated with achieving your goals and values. T able 8.1 shows this relationship in a graphic format. At this point, traders should understand that avoidin g these important tasks be - cause it is less e ff ortful and more comfortable to do so is clearly related to immediate personal contentment, but does nothin g for their tradin g . Avoidance derails tradin g g oals and personal development as a trader. A bi g part of the mental g ame for traders is developing the ability to do what is necessary for the trade even while experienc - in g unwanted thou g hts and feelin g s. The most important mental skill to develop in this re g ard is mindfulness. Keep in mind that mindfulness is not practiced to \u201cfi x\u201d or eliminate unwanted thoughts and feelings. That just brings us back to the struggle and playin g a fruitless tu g \u2010of\u2010war with our mind, a distraction at best.
