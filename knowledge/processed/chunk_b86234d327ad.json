Many traders will treat an entry like this as an entirely separate trade, perhaps continuing to hold part of the position from the Anti as well. F: What is this? A potential setup for a sell Anti? In this case, the short trade following F would have been a marginal winner, but once again the message is clear: being able to read developing market structure and price action can give a great insight into trade management. Anti Failures The Anti is a speci\ufb01c variant of the pullback trade, characterized by its location in the trend and the speci\ufb01c strong countertrend thrust setting up the pullback. Because it is a pullback, when the Anti pattern fails, it does so through the same patterns in which other pullbacks fail. This section shows three common Anti failures: failure through consoli- dation, failure near previous swing, and \ufb01nally, failure by strong momentum against the attempted trend change.

When a trade is entered, prices should quickly move from the entry price; if the market is able to trade around the entry price, this is more suggestive of balance between buyers and sellers. In this environment, tech- nical patterns have no edge. Figure 10.35 shows a buy Anti in Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Ltd (NYSE: YGE) at A. This was not an excellent example of an Anti because the preceding setup leg, the upswing, was only two bars and did not show a strong change of character. Not every pattern is textbook clear, and, though it may be counterintuitive, it is not necessarily true that better patterns have a higher expectancy. In this case, after a long entry somewhere around A, the stock simply went dead and quiet. This is not what should have happened\u2014if there were trapped shorts ner- vous about their positions, they should have covered aggressively and this buying pres- sure should have caused a sharp up move in the stock. When prices move contrary to what should be happening in a trade, it is time to adjust the trade: reduce exposure, tighten stops, or exit the trade completely. Failure Near Previous Swing FIGURE 10.36 A Sell Anti Finds Support at Previous Swing P1: OTA JWBT634-c10 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 8:1 Printer: Hamilton Printing Trade Examples: The Anti 335 Figure 10.36 shows a good sell Anti in Coffee futures. After a parabolic climax, a sharp downdraft, and slow bounce, a short position could have been entered somewhere around A. Remember that in any pullback trade, the \ufb01rst, most conservative, target is the extreme of the move setting up the pullback. In this case, the market was clearly having trouble getting through this target at B. Depending on the exact entry point and stop location, point B may have already been beyond the \ufb01rst pro\ufb01t target. If not, it would have been prudent to reduce risk somewhere in the bars following the failure to trade below the previous swing at B. Eventually, Coffee was able to slip below this support and appeared to be set to trade lower. However, a sharp failure at C swept price back above support. It might have been justi\ufb01able to hold a partial position through this large up day, especially if partial pro\ufb01ts had already been booked, but there is no reason to endure any more pain following C. This small bar, consolidating at the high of the move back above support, is a lower time frame consolidation and a strong indication that prices are headed higher in the near term. Always respect the message of developing market structure.
