Since some traders will treat moves out of complex pullbacks differently than those out of simple pullbacks, it is important to be able to discern this subtle cue. Figures 6.11 and 6.12 show examples of hidden complex pullbacks. In a sense, complex pullbacks are nothing more than a category of pullbacks, so all of the conditions for other pullback trades apply here, with one modi\ufb01cation. It is usually a good idea to avoid pullbacks after conditions that could indicate a buying or selling climax. We have looked at these parabolic expansions and have seen that they frequently cap trends, so it does not make sense to enter with-trend pullbacks after such a move. Con\ufb01rmation of the end of the trend is very strong countertrend momentum following such a condition, but market structure can unfold in another way: Rather than shifting into an immediate change of trend, the market can also consolidate and work off the overextension through a more extended consolidation. Normal (simple) pullbacks do this, as they give the market time to pause and digest each trend leg. In the case of a more serious overextension, a larger consolidation is usually required if the trend EURUSD - Daily Euro/ US Dollar ~ A 0.02000 u .. ------ ------------- ~ ---A ---~---~ -- 0.00500 7\"\"V VV - .,.. ._,..

If you see a condition that would normally eliminate the possibility of a pullback (e.g., a buying or selling climax), a with-trend trade may still be possible following a complex consolidation in that same area. It is often easier to evaluate the integrity of the trend on the higher time frame, as the trading time frame complex consolidation will usually be a simple consolidation on the higher time frame. Figure 6.13 shows one way a complex consolidation can provide a potential entry after a small buying climax. Trigger Either of the two triggers already discussed for pullbacks\u2014entering at sup- port or on a breakout\u2014are valid for complex consolidations. The support play, espe- cially if backed up by a momentum shift on the lower time frame, is easier in complex consolidations than in simple consolidations because the stop is more clearly established due to the termination of the second pullback leg. In addition, both countertrend legs of the pullback tend to be similar lengths, so it is often possible to predict the general area where the second leg will stop using a measured move objective (AB = CD).

But, if the market is able to hold together in a complex consolidation, a pullback Yes ? FIGURE 6.13 Complex Pullbacks Can Provide Entries Where Simple Pullbacks Should Be Avoided guideline for trends in general, but the market tends to respect this principle even more strongly in pullbacks.) Stop Another advantage of complex consolidations is that the stop level is more clearly de\ufb01ned. In simple consolidations, it is usually a bad idea to set a stop just un- derneath (for a long position) the consolidation area, but in complex pullbacks this is often an excellent risk point. There certainly are variations of complex pullbacks that have three or more pullbacks, each of which would result in another stop-out, but they are uncommon. The movements out of those also tend to be less reliable, so it does not make sense to make these a focus in the trading plan. Pro\ufb01t Target The same pro\ufb01t targets apply to complex as to simple pullbacks, per- haps with the expectation that a stronger move could develop from a complex consoli- dation. You might be justi\ufb01ed in taking less of your position off at your \ufb01rst pro\ufb01t target, and trying to press more size for a larger move compared to a simple pullback. If you decide to do this, weigh the bene\ufb01ts of having simple rules (e.g., take one-third of your position off at the previous swing) that enforce discipline and consistency against any incremental gains from a more complex approach.
