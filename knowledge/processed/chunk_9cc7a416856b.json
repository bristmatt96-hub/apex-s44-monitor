Exercise 9.3 Mental Skills Inventory: High-Quality Preparation Mental Domain Rating Perspective I maintain a balanced perspective between trading and the other important roles in my life. I am able to mentally park non\u2010trading\u2013related concerns while I am trading. I have a strong understanding of how I trade the markets which is refl ected in my written trading plan. I understand and act in concert with the laws of probability in trading, especially the idea that my trading edge will play out over a large number of trades. Personal Awareness I am clear on my strong points and my limitations in the mental, technical, money management, and other important areas of my trading. Self-Motivation I set and achieve goals with respect to my performance and development as a trader. For my current limitations, I have developmental goals framed as SMART goals. I focus on my trading process more than my trading results. Mental Discipline I follow my trading plan, understand how my willpower can be strengthened and depleted, and take steps to preserve and increase my mental discipline. I create a game plan for my trading. 40 This PDF file is part of the audiobook TRADE MINDFULLY and cannot be sold separately. It may not be reproduced, copied, circulated, or posted online.
