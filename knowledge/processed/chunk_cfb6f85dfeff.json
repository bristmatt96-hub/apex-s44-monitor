In Part 3 of this book, we cover a proven ap - proach for personal development and improvement as a trader, and in Chapter 11 we examine how expertise and mastery is developed through the psychological science of deliberate practice and how to specifi cally apply it to your trainin g and expert skill ac q uisition and develo p ment. \u25a0 Note 1.

It is also very likely that these strong feelings have caused erratic trading actions. You have had losses or missed profi ts because you acted too soon, acted inap- propriately, or failed to act at all. Strong emotions have affected your trading. You may have put extra effort into your trading to try to overcome this prob- lem, learning more about technical analysis and maybe trading psychology. But that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. When you get into a trade you almost immediately feel your nerves rise. Your attention rivets onto price action; you feel like you are living or dying on every tick. Soon, your heart is racing and your muscles become tense. Your discomfort is palpable. If your trade is in a little profi t, you r mind is urging you to get out now\u2014at least you will have a profi t, it says. Cer- tainly, you cannot have a loss. You might struggle a little longer and try to hold onto the trade, but your mind becomes insistent: \u201cGet out NOW!\u201d And, you do. You feel relief. Whew! All that tension is over. And, you made a small profi t. The relief feels good. Then, a few minutes later the market takes off and runs several points in your direction. A sizable profi t was forfeited because you were mentally and emotionally hijacked. How many times have you repeated this or similar experiences? You promise yourself you will chan ge but fail to follow through w ith your p lan. Fear, or anot her stron g emot ion, gets t he better o f you\u2014every t ime. You wonder if there is a better way. Yes, there is a better way. The fi rst step in learning how to deal with and overcome the erratic trading behavior caused by strong emotions is to help you bring clarity to your experiences so that you understand them on a deeper level than you do now. Let\u2019s get started. Strong Emotion s in Trading CHAPTER 2 36 T RADE MINDF U LLY C opin g wit h f ear an d anxiety is a si g ni fi cant c h a ll en g e f or many tra d ers.
