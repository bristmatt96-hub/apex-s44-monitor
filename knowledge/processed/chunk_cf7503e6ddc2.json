This strategy is described in more detail in Example 7.6.) Of course, I would not have traded this strategy without backtesting it on my own anyway, and indeed, my subse- quent backtest confirmed his findings. But the fact that my reader found significant flaws with the strategy is important confirmation that my own backtest is not erroneous. All in all, I have found that it is actually easier to gather and exchange trading ideas as an independent trader than when I was working in the secretive hedge fund world in New York. When I worked at Millennium Partners\u2014a 40-billion-dollar hedge fund on Fifth Avenue\u2014one trader ripped a published paper out of the hands of his programmer, who happened to have picked it up from the trad- er\u2019s desk. He was afraid the programmer might learn his \u201csecrets.\u201d (Lest you think that Millennium Partners is a bad place to work, I should add that its founder, Izzy Englander, personally spoke with my next employer to vouch for me.) That may be because people are less wary of letting you know their secrets when they think you won\u2019t be obliterating their profits by allocating $100 million to that strategy. No, the difficulty is not the lack of ideas. The difficulty is to develop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal cir - cumstances and goals, and which ones look viable even before you devote the time to diligently backtest them. This taste for prospec- tive strategies is what I will try to convey in this chapter. HOW TO IDENTIFY A STRATEGY THAT SUITS YOU Whether a strategy is viable often does not have anything to do with the strategy itself\u2014it has to do with YOU. Here are some con- siderations. Your Working Hours Do you trade only part time? If so, you would probably want to con- sider only strategies that hold overnight and not the intraday strat- egies. Otherwise, you may have to fully automate your strategies Chan800064_c02.indd 14 6/7/2021 7:17:56 AM 18 QUANTITATIVE TRADING downloaded only the split-and-dividend-adjusted Yahoo! Finance data using a now defunct program. But now you have easy and free access to that via many third-party APIs (more on the different databases and tools in Chapter 3). This database is not survivorship bias\u2013free\u2014but I was still using it for most of my backtesting for more than two years! In fact, a trader I know, who traded a million- dollar account, typically used such biased data for his backtesting, and yet his strategies were still profitable. How could this be pos- sible? Probably because these were intraday strategies. So, you see, as long as you are aware of the limitations of your tools and data, you can cut many corners and still succeed. (There are now afford- able survivorship-bias-free stock databases such as Sharadar, so I recommend you pay a small fee to use them.) Though futures afford you high leverage, some futures contracts have such a large size that it would still be impossible for a small account to trade. For instance, though the E-mini S&P 500 future (ES) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a margin require- ment of only $12,000, it has a market value of about $167,500, and a 10 percent or larger daily move will wipe out your account that holds only the minimum margin cash. In case you think that a 10 percent or larger move for the S&P 500 index is extremely rare, check out how many times it happened from February to April 2020.

A TASTE FOR PLAUSIBLE STRATEGIES AND THEIR PITFALLS Now, let\u2019s suppose that you have read about several potential strate- gies that fit your personal requirements. Presumably, someone else has done backtests on these strategies and reported that they have great historical returns. Before proceeding to devote your time to performing a comprehensive backtest on this strategy (not to men- tion devoting your capital to actually trading this strategy), there are a number of quick checks you can do to make sure you won\u2019t be wasting your time or money. How Does It Compare with a Benchmark, and How Consistent Are Its Returns? This point seems obvious when the strategy in question is a stock- trading strategy that buys (but not shorts) stocks. Everybody seems to know that if a long-only strategy returns 10 percent a year, it is not too fantastic because investing in an index fund will generate as good, if not better, returns on average. However, if the strategy is a long\u2013short dollar-neutral strategy (i.e., the portfolio holds long and short positions with equal capital), then 10 percent is quite a good return, because then the benchmark of comparison is not the mar - ket index, but a riskless asset such as the yield of the three-month US Treasury bill (which at the time of this writing is just about zero percent). Another issue to consider is the consistency of the",
