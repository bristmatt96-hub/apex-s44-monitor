Trigger Conceptually, this is the most problematic of the trade setups because we have to strike a balance between waiting for con\ufb01rmation that the breakout has failed while still getting a good trade location. In terms of actual execution, the breakout fail- ure is nothing more than a failed pullback. Breakout traders need to understand that the pullback pattern is a critical building block for these trades, and it is important to understand the patterns that suggest pullbacks failing and continuing.

Some traders, when they are considering a trade, will use multiple indicators and analytical tools, solicit opinions from other traders, and even consider elements such as fundamentals that do not really have a bearing on their time frame. This approach can lead to \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d as so many fac- tors are considered, with so many con\ufb02icting points of view, that the trader simply does not know what to do. The justi\ufb01cation offered for this approach is that an of\ufb01cer on a battle\ufb01eld would want every possible piece of information, wouldn\u2019t he? Perhaps not. It might be better for the decision maker to have processed intelligence from veri\ufb01ed and trusted sources that has already been \ufb01ltered from the massive \ufb02ow of raw infor- mation. In trading, the equivalent is to focus on a few simple tools that are completely understood\u2014depth of information, rather than breadth. It is critical that traders understand the subtleties of every tool they use. They should know how they react in every possible market environment, and furthermore, must un- derstand the complex interactions between multiple tools. This may lead to an approach that disregards a lot of information that many traders assume to be useful, but, for in- stance, why would you use indicators that do not add to your analysis? Why would you listen to news that is old news and is already fully priced into the market? Why would you try to guess how complex fundamental factors might in\ufb02uence the price if you do not have the skills to fully understand those fundamentals? Why would you solicit opinions from traders who may trade with completely different styles and may be less competent 189 P1: OTA JWBT634-c07 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 7:44 Printer: Hamilton Printing Tools for Con\ufb01rmation 191 and do not pass simple statistical tests. People will claim that certain averages are impor- tant because \u201chedge funds buy there,\u201d \u201ceveryone watches those averages,\u201d or \u201cit becomes a self-ful\ufb01lling prophecy,\u201d but it is extremely dif\ufb01cult to support these claims with quanti- tative tests. Tests of statistical tendencies around moving averages fail to \ufb01nd that any av- erage is objectively better than another, or in fact, that there is any veri\ufb01able edge around these averages at all. Regardless, there are practical ways to use these tools in trading. As a Trend Indicator One potentially useful application of moving averages is to use them as con\ufb01rming trend indicators. For instance, when scanning many charts, a quick glance at a moving average\u2014which summarizes the price structure, smoothes out the bumps, and highlights the overall trend\u2014can give a quick read on the overall market structure. There are two broad ways to use moving averages as trend indicators, which can be used separately or combined. The \ufb01rst is very simple: when price spends a lot of time on one side of a moving average, this suggests the market is trending in that direction; see Figure 7.1 for an example. Note that price may occasionally dip to the average, or even cross a bit to the other side, but it remains mostly above the average. The second idea, which is closely related, is that a moving average will slope in the direction of the trend. A \ufb02at moving average is more indicative of a trading range, while up-sloping and down-sloping averages suggest uptrends and downtrends.
