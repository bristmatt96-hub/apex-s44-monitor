Special Topics in Quantitative Trading 191 \u2022 One of the most well-known factor models is the Fama-French Three-Factor model, which postulates that stock returns are proportional to their beta and book-to-price ratio, and negatively to their market capitalizations. \u2022 Factor models typically have a relatively long holding period and long drawdowns due to regime switches. \u2022 Exit signals should be created differently for mean-reversion versus momentum strategies. \u2022 Estimation of the optimal holding period of a mean-revert- ing strategy can be quite robust, due to the Ornstein-Uhlen- beck formula. \u2022 Estimation of the optimal holding period of a momentum strat- egy can be error prone due to the small number of signals. \u2022 Stop loss can be suitable for momentum strategies but not rever- sal strategies. \u2022 Seasonal trading strategies for stocks (i.e., calendar effect) have become unprofitable in recent years. \u2022 Seasonal trading strategies for commodity futures continue to be profitable. \u2022 High-frequency trading strategies rely on the \u201claw of large num- bers\u201d for their high Sharpe ratios. \u2022 High-frequency trading strategies typically generate the highest long-term compounded growth due to their high Sharpe ratios. \u2022 High-frequency trading strategies are very difficult to backtest and very technology-reliant for their execution. \u2022 Holding a highly leveraged portfolio of low-beta stocks should generate higher long-term compounded growth than holding an unleveraged portfolio of high-beta stocks. Most statistical arbitrage trading strategies are some combina- tion of these effects or models: Whether they are profitable or not is more of an issue of where and when to apply them than whether they are theoretically correct.

It is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again in January 2021. They brought back bad memories of other notorious hedge fund debacles such as that of Long-Term Capital Management and Amaranth Advi- sors (both referenced in Chapter 6 ), except that this time it was not just one trader or one firm, but losses at multiple funds over a short period of time. And yet, ever since I began my career in the institutional quan- titative trading business, I have spoken to many small, independ- ent traders, working in shabby offices or their spare bedrooms, who gain small but steady and growing profits year-in and year-out, quite unlike the stereotypical reckless day traders of the popular imagi- nation. In fact, many independent traders that I know of have not only survived the periods when big funds lost billions, but actually thrived in",
