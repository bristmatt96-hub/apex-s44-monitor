Strangle\u2014A long (short) call and a long (short) put, where both options have the same underlying contract, the same expiration date, but different exercise prices. Strap\u2014An archaic term for a position consisting of two long (short) calls and one long (short) put where all options have the same underlying contract, the same expiration date, and the same exercise price. Strike Price (Strike)}\u2014Exercise price. Strip\u2014aAn archaic term for a position consisting of one long (short) call and two long (short) puts where all options have the same underlying contract, the same expiration date, and the same exercise price. Also: A series of futures or futures options designed to replicate the characteristics of a long-term contract or option. A Glossary of Option and Related Terminology 429 Swap\u2014An agreement to exchange different cash flows. Most commonly a swap involves exchanging variable rate interest payments for payments calculated from a fixed interest rate. Swaption\u2014An option to enter into a swap agreement. Synthetic\u2014A combination of contracts having approximately the same characteristics as a different contract. Synthetic Call\u2014A long (short) underlying position together with a long (short) put. Synthetic Put\u2014A short (long) underlying position together with a long (short) call. Synthetic Underlying\u2014A long (short) call and short {long} put, where both options have the same underlying contract, the same expiration date, and the same exercise price. Tau (t)\u2014The commonly used notation for the amount of time remaining to expiration. Theoretical Value\u2014An option value generated by a mathematical model given cer- tain prior assumptions about the terms of the option, the characteristics of the underly- ing contract, and prevailing interest rates. Theta (@)\u2014The sensitivity of an option\u2019s theoretical value to a change in the amount of time remaining to expiration. Three-Way\u2014A position similar to a conversion or reversal, but where the long or short position in the underlying instrument has been replaced with a very deeply-in-the- money call or put. Time Box\u2014A long call and short put with the same exercise price and expiration date, together with a short call and long put at a different exercise price and expiration date. This is simply a jelly roll using different exercise prices. Time Premium\u2014Time value. Time Spread\u2014The purchase (sale) of one option expiring on one date and the sale (purchase) of another option expiring on a different date. Typically, both options are of the same type, have the same exercise price, and have the same underlying stock or commodity. Time Value\u2014The price of an option less its intrinsic value. The price of an out-of the- money option consists solely of time value. Type\u2014tThe designation of an option as either a call or a put. Underlying \u2014The instrument to be delivered in the event an option is exercised. 430 Appendix A Variation\u2014The cash flow resulting each day from changes in the settlement price of a futures contract. Vega\u2014The sensitivity of an option\u2019s theoretical value to a change in volatility. Vertical Spread\u2014The purchase of one option and sale of one option, where both options are of the same type, have the same underlying contract, and expire at the same time, but have different exercise prices. Volatility\u2014The degree to which the price of an underlying instrument tends to fluctuate over time. Volatility Skew\u2014The tendency of options at different exercise prices to trade at different implied volatilities. Warrant\u2014A long-term call option. The expiration date of a warrant may under some circumstances be extended by the issuer. Write\u2014Sell an option. % Appendix B + The Mathematics of Option Pricing OPTION PRICING MODELS I.
