Use Exercise 9.2 to assess your personal stren g ths and limitations. When assessin g your strengths and limitations, write down trading related mental and technical skills and abilities that you do well and thin g s that need work. Under mental skills and abili - ties, consider your mindfulness skills and abilities at mental parkin g . Also consider how well you can hold a trade to its logical conclusion. Can you stick",
