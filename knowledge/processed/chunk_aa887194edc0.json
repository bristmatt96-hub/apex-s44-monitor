When we solve for the implied volatility of an option we are assuming that the theoretical value (the option\u2019s price} is known, but that the volatility is unknown. In effect, we are running the theoretical pricing model backwards to solve for this unknown, as shown in Figure 4-9. In fact, this is easier said than done since most theoretical pricing models cannot be reversed. However, a number of computer programs have been written which can quickly solve for the implied volatility when all other inputs are known. Note that the implied volatility depends on the theoretical pricing model being used. For some options, a different model can yield a significantly different implied volatility. The accuracy of an implied volatility also depends on the accuracy of inputs into the model. This not only includes the price of the option, but the other inputs as well. In particular, problems can occur when an option has not traded for some time, but market conditions have changed significantly. Suppose in our example the price of 1.34 for the 105 call reflected the last trade, but that trade took place two hours ago when the underlying futures contract was actually at 99.25. If the price of the underlying contract is 99.25, the implied volatility of the option at a price of 1.34 is actually 17.3%. This is a significant difference, and underscores the importance of accurate and timely inputs when calculating implied volatilities. Services which supply theoretical analysis of options usually include implied volatilities. The implied volatilities may be for each option on an underlying contract, or there may be one implied volatility which is representative of all options on the same Figure 4-9 Using the Model to Solve for a Theoretical Value Knowns Unknowns Exercise Price (105) Theoretical Value Time to Expiration (3 months) (2? = .96) Underlying Futures Price (98.50) Interest Rates (8%) Volatility (16%) Using the Model to Solve for an Implied Volatility Knowns Unknowns Exercise Price (105) Implied Volatility Time to Expiration (3 months) (72 = 18.5%) Underlying Futures Price (98.50) Interest Rates (8%) Option Price (1.34) 74 Chapter 4 underlying. In the latter case, the figure will usually represent an average of all the individual implied volatilities. The single implied volatility is weighted according to some criteria, sich as volume of options traded, open interest, or, as is most common, by assigning the greatest weight to the at-the-money options. The implied volatility in the marketplace is constantly changing because option prices, as well as other market conditions, are constantly changing. It is as if the marketplace were continuously polling all participants to come up with a consensus volatility for the underlying contract. This is not a poll in the true sense, since all traders do not huddle together and eventually vote on the correct volatility. However, as bids and offers are made, the trade price of an option will represent the equilibrium between supply and demand. This equilibrium can be translated into an implied volatility. Even though the term premium really refers to an option\u2019s price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied volatility as the premium or premium level If the current implied volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is unusually low, he might say that premium levels are low. Assuming a trader had a reliable theoretical pricing model, if he could look into a crystal ball and determine the future volatility of an underlying contract he would be able to accurately evaluate options on that contract. He might then look at the difference between each option\u2019s theoretical value and its price in the marketplace, selling any options which were overpriced relative to the theoretical value, and buying any options which were underpriced. If given the choice between selling one of two overpriced options, he might simply sell the one which was most overpriced in total dollars. However, a trader who has access to implied volatilities might use a different yardstick for comparison. He might compare the implied volatility of an option to either a volatility forecast, or to the implied volatility of other options on the same underlying contract. Going back to our example of the 105 call, we might say that with a theoretical value of .96 anda price of 1.34, the 105 call is .38 overpriced. But in volatility terms it is 2.5% overpriced since its theoretical value is based on a volatility of 16% (the trader\u2019s volatility estimate) while its price is based on a volatility of 18.5% (the implied volatility). Due to the unusual characteristics of options, it is often more useful for the serious trader to consider an option\u2019s price in terms of implied volatility rather than in terms of its total dollar price. For example, suppose a Treasury Bond 98 call is trading for 3-32 ($3,500) with a corresponding implied volatility of 10.5%. Suppose also that a 102 call with the same expiration date is trading for 1-16 ($1,250) with an implied volatility of 11.5%. In total dollar terms the 102 call is $2,250 cheaper than the 98 call. Yet an experienced trader will probably conclude that in theoretical terms the 98 call is actually less expensive than the 102 call because the implied volatility of the 98 call is a full percentage point less than the implied volatility of the 102 call. Does this mean that one ought to buy the 98 call and sell the 102 call? Not necessarily. If the future volatility of the Treasury Bonds turns out to be 8%, then both options are overpriced; while if volatility turns out to be 14%, both options are underpriced. Moreover, the leverage values of the options may not be the same so that their sensitivity to changes in market conditions may, under Volatility 75 some circumstances, make",
