Figure 1.16 shows an example of a two-legged complex pullback. On the higher trading time frame, it is not so obvious and has to be inferred from the presence of one or two with-trend candles in the middle of the pullback, but the complete structure is clearly visible on the lower time frame. One of the quanti\ufb01able tendencies of price motion is for markets to make directional moves out of periods of contracted volatility. Even if the normal expectation for a market is mean reversion and reversal (as it is in the short term for equities), there is usually at least a slight edge for continuation out of areas of volatility compression. One simple way to quantify volatility contraction is by looking for inside bars, which are bars whose entire range is enclosed within the range of the previous bar\u2014in other words, a bar whose high is equal to or lower than the previous high and whose low is above or equal to the previous low. A series of multiple inside bars on one time frame usually contains a 1.43300 1.43400 1.43200 1.43300 ' ' r -- --- - 1.43200 1.43100 1.43100 ' ' 1.43000 I 1.43000 ' ' ' ' 1.42900 1.42900 ' ' ' ' ' 1.42800 ' ' ' 1.42800 ' ' ' \u00b7 1.42700 l '--ol--._ 1.42700 1.42600 ' ' 1.42500 ' ' ' 1.42600 1.42400 1.42500 1.42300 1.42400 1.42200 6:00 6:30 7:00 6:00 11 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Trading within triangles is usually a losing proposition, as the market is in equilibrium and the actual movement within the pattern is highly random. However, they can set up good breakouts with expectations for strong, extended moves away from the pattern. It is easy to overlook multiple inside bars (see Figure 1.17), but this is a powerful and subtle pattern that is worth some attention. The examples in this section were deliberately chosen to be less than perfect be- cause it is important to start thinking about these concepts in the context of actual mar- ket action, which is always less clear and noisier than we wish. Remember that charts are arti\ufb01cial structures that we impose on market data. They are useful because they organize the data, but we are always dealing with a trade-off between effective summa- rization and loss of detail. There is no perfect answer, but many of the limitations can be overcome if we work to constantly remember what the chart actually is, and to try to understand the buying and selling pressure that each bar represents. The chart is not the market; the chart is a representation of the market.

A book would come in the mail at the beginning of the week, printed on newsprint; each day it was up to the trader to track down prices for each of the markets and update the charts by drawing a new price bar. At the beginning of the next week, a new book would arrive with the past week\u2019s prices \ufb01lled in, and the process would repeat. Actually, in my very early trading days I did not even have the chart book, but I bought a pad of graph paper, went to the library, and started building charts from histories I found in back issues of newspapers. I did not realize the value of what I was doing at the time,",
