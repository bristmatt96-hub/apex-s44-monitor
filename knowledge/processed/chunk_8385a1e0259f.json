  "content": "in Figure 17-1b where the downward slope of the graph above 105 becomes more pronounced as time passes. Gamma can also change as time passes. At-the-money options always have the highest gamma, and the gamma of an at-the-money option can increase rapidly as expiration approaches. As time passes note how the curvature of the position becomes mote severe around the stock price of 105. If the stock should rise to 105 and remain there as expiration approaches, the position will take on increasingly greater gamma risk, Since a ratio vertical spread has a negative vega, any rise in volatility will hurt the position, and any decline will help. The theoretical value of the position at various volatilities is shown in Figure 17-1c. Under current conditions the position has an implied volatility of approximately 25%, the volatility at which the position approxi- mately breaks even, showing neither profit nor loss. (We can also approximate the implied volatility of the position by dividing the total theoretical edge of 12.20 by the vega of 2.38, and adding the result to the 20% volatility we are currently using.) If the stock price should change, the implied volatility of the position will also change.

At a stock price of 106, the position has an implied volatility of approximately 15%. As the stock price rises, we hope for a lower and lower volatility. The delta risk will also change as volatility changes since deltas move away from 50 as volatility falls and towards 50 as volatility rises. If volatility falls, the position will become delta positive; if volatility rises, the position will become delta negative. We can see this by looking at the slope of the graph at the current stock price of 99. With a volatility below 20%, the graph has a positive slope; with a volatility above 20%, the graph has a negative slope. Let\u2019s look at another position: Stock price = 100.00 Time to expiration: June = 7 weeks, September = 20 weeks Volatility = 20%; Interest rate = 6%; Dividend = 0 Option Option Option Option Position Price Th.

Vol. long 20 June 105 calls 1.88 1.35 30 24.0 short 20 September 110 calls 3.13 2.22 30 24.1 Position Analysis 357 This position is a diagonal spread, but with both options having equal deltas the position will tend to act like a short time spread. The total theoretical edge is: -20 x (1.88-1.35) + 20 x (3.13-2.22) = +7.60 We know that a short time spread has a positive gamma, negative theta, and negative vega. The gamma, theta, and vega sensitivities of the spread are: Option Gamma Theta Vega June 105 call 4.3 \u2014.0308 128 September 110 call 2.8 -.0200 216 position totals +30.0 -.2160 -.760 The positive gamma means that movement in the underlying stock price is working in our favor, as shown in Figure 17-2a. As the stock price rises, our delta position is becoming longer, and as the stock price falls, it is becoming shorter. If we want to stay delta neutral we will need to sell stock as the price rises, and buy stock as the price falls. Since a positive gamma is always accompanied by a negative theta, the passage of time will work against us, as shown in Figure 17-2b. Under current conditions, for each day that passes with no movement in the underlying stock price, our position will deteriorate by approximately .216. We can also see that with the stock below 105 the slope of the graph becomes negative as time passes, reflecting the fact that our delta Figure 17-2a: Long 20 June 105 Calls @ 1.88 Short 20 September 110 Calls @ 3.13 90 807 70- 60- 507 40-4 theoretical profit & loss 30- 20- 105 T T T T 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 15 120 125 130 stock price 358 Chapter 17 Figure 17-2b: Long 20 June 105 Calls @ 1.88 Short 20 September 110 Calls @ 3.13 1007 80- 607 7 weeks to June expiration | 405 | 4 weeks to June ree | 207 theoretical profit & loss . a 1 week to June expiration AL at June expiration -207 -40 T T T T T T T T 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 stock price position is becoming shorter with the passage of time. If the stock price should rise above 105, our delta position becomes longer with the passage of time. At June expiration we want the stock to be as far away from 105 as possible. As the stock price moves toward 105, the curvature of the position also becomes more severe, reflecting the fact that the gamma of an at-the-money option increases with the passage of time. In Figure 17-2c we can see how the position\u2019s value declines (rises) with rising (falling) volatility. The implied volatility of the position is just under 25%. While changing volatility can affect the delta and gamma of a position, we can see in Figure 17-2c that in this spread the delta and gamma are generally unaffected by changes in volatility. Regardless of volatility, the delta position remains neutral at the current stock price of 100, becomes shorter anywhere below 100, and becomes longer anywhere above 100. Moreover, the graphs all have the same general shape, reflecting the fact that the position\u2019s gamma is not particularly sensitive to changes in volatility.
