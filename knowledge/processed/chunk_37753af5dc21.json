  "content": "in life; it\u2019s not just about trading. Often, people experience a disappointing result, but there may be hidden reasons that are more compelling and drove that outcome. That\u2019s two. What about a third quote? I like Jim Rogers\u2019s quote: \u201cI just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime.\u201d It is such a colorful way of describing the quality of patience to wait for the right trade\u2014a critical trait in success ful trading. What is the quote you think about often? Anybody who\u2019s ever worked for me would know exactly what I\u2019m going to say because I bring it up all the time. It\u2019s the same line you mentioned: \u201cEverybody gets what they want.\u201d It\u2019s become an ethos of the way that I live life. It\u2019s almost like a law of the universe. If I\u2019m speaking to a large company, and I think they\u2019ll never be interested in our product, and I don\u2019t belong in the same room as these people, then that is the outcome I will get. If, instead, I believe that our product can help them and that there is every reason I will be successful, that is the outcome I will get. Three hours north of where we are having this conversation, in Orlando, there\u2019s Disney World, which is built on swampland. Can you think of a worse place for crowds of people to have a positive outdoor experience than a swamp? There are more mosquitos in swamps than anywhere else. Any rational person would have said it was a crazy idea to build a huge theme park on swampland. But the chief engineer [William \u201cJoe\u201d Potter] knew what he wanted, and he made it happen by designing Disney World so that any water in the park is always moving. Even the buildings are designed to not allow still water to collect anywhere. That is a classic example of someone getting what they wanted. Everyone would have said the project was impossible, but the answer was as simple as just moving water. So, in everything I do, I ask, \u201cAm I putting myself in a position to get what I want, or am I the blocker in the situation?\u201d What has been your favorite thing about the Market Wizards journey? There is a sense of satisfaction in having written books that appealed to so many people worldwide. Over the years, I\u2019ve received many emails and phone calls from readers expressing gratitude for the positive impact the 93 books have had on their trading and their lives. It is humbling to know that my books have changed people\u2019s lives. Also, the books allowed me to speak at numerous events and travel to many different countries. Something that deeply impacted me was the inscription you wrote in one of your books and gave to me before I left for college. It was the most perfect advice that anyone could receive. I don\u2019t remember. What did I write? I have it framed on my wall right here: Follow your talent. Choose what interests you. Don\u2019t settle for less than your best. Be honest. Believe in what you can achieve. That is a good summary of my philosophy. That inscription summarizes everything we talked about today. \u201cFollow your talent\u201d goes back to what you said about everyone having their own particular skill. It also relates to why you switched majors and why you focused on writing instead of trading. \u201cChoose what interests you\u201d reminds me of your description of Shapiro, the contrarian trader, who pursues a trading style that reflects who he is. Your copper article perfectly exemplifies \u201cDon\u2019t settle for less than your best.\u201d If you did anything less than your best, you might never have gotten your first job and the entire career that followed. \u201cBe honest\u201d is a core principle if you want to have long-standing relationships. It also relates to trading because you must be honest with yourself. \u201cBelieve in what you can achieve\u201d ties into getting what you want. If you don\u2019t have that belief, you won\u2019t achieve your goal because you\u2019re the barrier to getting what you want. Honesty is something that I got from my father; he was absolutely honest. 94 I have a visceral memory of when the importance of honesty hit me. I was probably about nine or ten, and we lived in Goldens Bridge. You were driving me home. I don\u2019t know if you remember, but there was this old mansion with colonial pillars on a large plot of land, which was a real outlier in the neighborhood. It was situated right at a road fork we always passed on the way home. You asked me whether I had eaten a pack of cookies, and I lied and said I did not. You pulled the car over at that fork, turned to me, and said, \u201cZachary, if you do anything in life, you have to be honest. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d That moment just stayed with me.",
