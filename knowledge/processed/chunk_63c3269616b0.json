The number of the 1,000 traders who go bankrupt is recorded, and the percentage is presented at the bottom of the table. Percent of accounts bankrupt = Number of accounts with terminal balance \u2264 $0/1,000 We also will record the number of accounts than end up with a greater than 75 per- cent loss from the starting value. Though this is an arbitrary cutoff, it will serve to mea- sure some of the downside risks in some of the more extreme scenarios later on. In reality, an account is in trouble long before it reaches a 75 percent drawdown. Consider the results in Table 9.1. On average, we end up with $149,259, which is close to the theoretical $150,000 from the expected value equation. (Keep in mind that 1,000 test runs is actually a small num- ber; had we done 100,000 or 1,000,000 runs, this number would almost certainly have TABLE 9.1 Results of 1,000 Monte Carlo Runs Risking $2,000 per Trade in $100,000 Account Mean Terminal Value 149,259 Median Terminal Value 152,000 Standard Deviation of Terminal Value 33,760 Coe\ufb03cient of Variation 0.23 Mean of Maximum Value 159,070 Mean of Minimum Value 89,254 Highest Terminal Value 253,200 Lowest Terminal Value 50,800 Percent Terminal Drawdown \u226575% 0.0% Percent of Accounts Bankrupt 0.0% 112 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

Note that the only thing that changed is this risk level; the trades for these runs were generated with a pseudo-random number generator, and the same random sequence was used in each set of 1,000 trades. The win/loss sequences are the same for the set of 1,000 trials and for each column in Table 9.2. (On a technical note, this kind of reproducibility is important in Monte Carlo testing, and is a strong argument against building these tests using Excel\u2019s built-in random number generator.) What do we notice here? First, the simplistic understanding that some traders have that \u201cthe more you risk, the more you make\u201d does seem to have some validity. As we increase the amount risked per trade, the average terminal value increases, as does the mean of the maximum value; risking $5,000 per trade gives us almost 50 percent more pro\ufb01t than our initial $2,000 risk. However, there is a cost. The standard deviation of ter- minal values increases faster than the mean, which can be seen by the steadily risking coef\ufb01cient of variation. If we accept, for a moment, the standard deviation as a measure of risk, we",
