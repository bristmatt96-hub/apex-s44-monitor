If you have made the e ff ort to complete the exercises and have applied some of the methods presented in the book, you may now be able to begin recognizing the mental shortcuts that aff ect your trading and to engage your deliberative mind better, and you may now see the infl uence of cognitive heuristics and biases beginning to subside. For traders who have become ensnared in thoughts and feelings of fear or other strong emotions, if you have started practicing mindful- ness, you may b e a bl e to b egin d e f using f rom t h ose t h oug h ts an d f ee l ings, maintain b etter attention on t h e mar k et, an d start to ta k e t h e actions t h at support your tra d es. Y ou are now on the track to g reater success. However, overcomin g psycholo g ical c h a ll en g es is on l y one aspect o f tra d in g psyc h o l o g y . For tra d ers to maximize t h eir tra d ing per f ormance t h ere is anot h er very important aspect o f tra d ing psyc h o l ogy traders need to know and learn: performance psycholo g y. So far we have dealt only with what seems to be \u201cne g ative\u201d psycholo g y: the psy- c h o l ogy o f negative emotions, unwante d t h oug h ts, cognitive b iases, an d erratic behaviors. But there is a \u201cpositive\u201d side of psycholo g y traders can employ in their The Trading P syc h o l o gy g Process: High- Quality Preparation g CHAPTER 9 209THE TRADING PSYCHOLOGY PROCESS: HIGH-QUALITY PREPARATION Simi l ar l y, t h e During time frame is all about Eff ective Tradin g Execution (EE), and we will discuss the associated hi g h-value activities and mental skills of Eff ective Execution . O ur After time frame involves the psychological skills and activities of r Constructive Se lf \u2010Assessment (CSA). It is in t h is time f rame t h at we intentiona lly evaluate our tradin g performance. Once we understand the HVMSs and HV As within each of the time frames, we can t h en assess ourse l ves on eac h d omain an d d etermine w h ere we are strong or wea k . From h ere, we can ta k e steps to en h ance our tra d ing per f ormance an d our persona l self\u2010development. Not only do we have an inventory of HVMSs/HV As and proce - d ures to b enc h mar k our tra d ing per f ormance, t h is same inventory a l so gives us a h ig hl y e ff ective and practical process to follow . In this chapter we will focus on the mental e l ements an d activities o f Hig h -Qua l ity Preparation.

Each of the three major areas is further divided into hi g h\u2010value mental skills. High-Quality Preparation, for example, is subdivided into the HVMSs of: Perspective, Personal Awareness, Self\u2010Motivation, and Mental Discipline. W e dis - cuss each of these mental skills alon g with the specifi c tradin g activities that to g ether form the process of High-Quality Preparation in this chapter. As we go through the details and discuss these HVMSs, think about how you mi g ht rank yourself on each of them. How consistent are you in each? The closer you score yourself to bein g fully consistent, the more dialed in you are for that high-value mental skill. Less consis - tency su gg ests you have some work to do in that area. The idea is to measure where y ou are in each of these mental domains. For each of the next three chapters, y ou are provided with a set of questions you can use to assess yourself in each of these important areas. These self\u2010assessment tools come at the end of each chapter.
