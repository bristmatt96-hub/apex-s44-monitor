This is an excellent pattern on which to base a short trade, but in this case it was not to be. At the point marked A, buyers swept the market up through the top of the pullback, back above support, and it did not look back. It absolutely is necessary to limit your risk on these patterns, because many of them will not return to your entry price after they fail. In fact, if the pattern was a truly excel- lent setup, there may be many traders trapped on the wrong side of the market, and this pressure can sometimes create a long-term in\ufb02ection point in a trend. Imagine shorting at the very bottom of a turn into an uptrend, and shorting more as the market rallies, only to see a full-\ufb02edged uptrend emerge. Traders will inevitably be caught in situations like this; it is the task of risk management to make sure that they become normal, planned-for losses and not outright disasters. However, there is another important pattern to be aware of. It is sometimes pos- sible to turn trapped traders to our advantage, as many excellent trades are driven by traders trapped either into or out of the market.

This, obviously, is not good. However, take a look at Figure 3.22, which shows a complex consolidation in an uptrend in the E-mini S&P 500 Futures. At the point marked A, the consolidation had failed: the pattern was broken by two large candles under the bottom of the pattern, with a close far underneath at A. If you were an aggressive short, it might even have been reasonable to initiate a short on this bar, but look carefully at what hap- pened next. There was no momentum and no selling conviction below the level. Within two days, the market was solidly back above the consolidation, went on to take out the highs, and put in another trend leg over the next several weeks. This is an extremely im- portant pattern for pullback traders, who are always trying to \ufb01nd the ideal combination of trade location and probability. Usually, buying as low as possible means buying when prices are declining, but this type of failure at the bottom of the consolidation allows an entry at low prices that is also aligned with short-term momentum. This is an outstanding entry pattern for pullback traders.

This, of course, is the best-case outcome, but it is far more common to \ufb01nd pullback trades that give opportunities for smaller pro\ufb01ts. More consistent results will come from taking at least partial pro\ufb01ts at a more conservative pro\ufb01t target; the pivot high or low (in an uptrend or a downtrend, respectively) of the setup leg is an ideal target and should be considered the \ufb01rst, most conservative pro\ufb01t target for any pullback trade. Figure 3.23 shows this pullback target schematically for both uptrends and downtrends. The third pullback failure occurs around this pro\ufb01t target\u2014either before, at, or just beyond it. It is not necessary to examine each possibility in detail, because they are all conceptually the same. The market reaches the neighborhood of the \ufb01rst pro\ufb01t target and simply is not able to trade very far beyond that target. For traders taking partial pro\ufb01ts here, these patterns are not even actually failures; the \ufb01rst target was reached. The important point is that traders should always be on guard for potential failure at this area, particularly in the area of previous pivots (e.g., the high of the setup trend leg preceding the pullback). There are many possibilities for trade management,",
