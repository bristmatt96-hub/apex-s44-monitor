Almost any random line drawn in the market will function as believable support or resistance. Create Your Own Support and Resistance Levels 1. Take a price chart of any market and hide the bars. Depending on your charting pack- age, there are many ways to do this, but the easiest is probably to set the color of the bars the same as the background of the chart. 2. Draw random lines on the chart. They may slant as trend lines, be horizontal, or even be curves. When you draw them, you will be drawing on a blank chart space, so many of the lines will not touch prices. This is \ufb01ne\u2014they are random lines, after all. 3. Restore the price bars and then look at each point where price touches your random lines. Imagine that these are important levels, generated by whatever process you use to \ufb01nd your support and resistance levels.

FIGURE 4.5 If Reward Is Much Greater Than Risk, Is It Always a Good Idea to Buy Here? reward/risk ratio will also shift, again resulting in an expected value of zero. There is no possible way to pro\ufb01t in a random walk market\u2014 this is absolutely axiomatic . If it is not intuitive, you must work with these concepts until it is; without that understanding, it is very dif\ufb01cult to trade pro\ufb01tably. So there is no escaping this truth\u2014if you are buying in front of support or shorting in front of resistance, you must have an edge beyond just having a much larger pro\ufb01t target than stop loss. You must have a reason for expecting nonrandom price action off the level. Clean or Sloppy Tests Support and resistance often do not hold perfectly clean tests. Allowing for these sloppy tests may sometimes lure us into seeing levels where none actually exist, but they actually are a reality of market action. There is no perfect solution here, but one thing to consider is the past history of price action around a level. If it has been violated many times with sloppy tests, it is reasonable to assume that future tests will also be sloppy. Figure 4.6 shows examples of several sloppy support tests in Net\ufb02ix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) on a daily chart. Just by looking at the chart, you can see this stock has not held clean levels in the past, so it would be unrealistic to expect it to start doing so in the future. However, even if a market does tend to hold levels cleanly, this does not mean that these levels are easy to trade. It might seem as though a good plan would be to get a position as close to a level as possible, and to stop out a tick on the other side of the level. In many cases, the catalyst for an up move may be a drop of clean support, which will generate volatile selling as stop orders are triggered, followed by strong buying that pushes the market back above the level. (Obviously, the reverse applies for resistance.) The market essentially knows where stop orders are likely to cluster, and those stops will often be targeted. Figure 4.7 shows some examples of very clean support and resistance on an intraday chart of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX). (Note that the lines have been offset from prices to highlight the clean tests.) Though the eye is drawn to these clean levels, notice that this same chart has other points with sloppier tests of levels.
