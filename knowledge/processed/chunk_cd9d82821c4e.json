An entry could have been attempted at A, but most traders would have wanted to see more decisive action above resistance to set up an entry. B: The best entry for this trade is probably at B, but it may also have been a second entry for traders who booked a loss following A. Consider expectations for a trade like this, particularly in a market-leading momentum stock: If the trade is correct, the stock should immediately melt. There should be sharp and clean downward momentum away from the level. C: This downward momentum did not develop, and the trade eventually failed at C. In this case, the preceding consolidation was small, only two or three bars. It is a challenge to make adjustments to the trade within this time period, so it is reasonable to expect that a trader might have booked another loss at C. This is another reason for doing these trades on half risk, relative to most other trade classes. In this example, a trader might have taken full losses following two entries at both A and B. Though unusual, this does happen, so it must be anticipated in the trading and risk management plans.

In this case, the exit was fortuitous, coming on the day following the ultimate high for the move; not all trades will have outcomes this dramatic, but you must respect the potential for a very dangerous countertrend move when the climax \ufb01nally turns. A: \u201cI have been ... able to tighten the stop to above the entry price. I am still deeply distrustful of the trend ... , but, for now, am positioned to take advantage of any continued upside.\u201d This is a case of using a high and tight pullback to tighten the stop on an existing trade. Though no contracts were added in this pattern, a failure of the pattern would have been very bad for the trade, so a tighter stop was justi\ufb01ed. Consider also that, even though I was uncomfortable with the potential in the trade, I did not exit and so was positioned to pro\ufb01t from the ensuing uptrend. B: \u201cSilver is certainly overbought by any measure, but this is not a case where fading strength is justi\ufb01ed.\u201d Taken alone, the concepts of overbought and oversold are dangerous and are probably overemphasized in much of the literature. Strong trends reach overextended levels and just keep going. C: \u201cMy aggressive addition to Silver worked ... stop [is now] just under yesterday\u2019s low.\u201d The two small days provided another entry point to add additional exposure\u2014yet another variation of the high and tight consolidation . P1: OTA JWBT634-c10 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 8:1 Printer: Hamilton Printing Trade Examples: Trading Parabolic Climaxes 325 D: \u201cI have moved the stop to just below yesterday\u2019s low. In the intermediate term, everything suggests higher prices, and the possibility of extreme volatility. The challenge is ... balancing pro\ufb01t taking ... [against] holding a core position.\u201d E: \u201cThe break, when it does come, could be dramatic. ... I am working a tight stop very close to yesterday\u2019s low.\u201d F: \u201cI am ratcheting the stop very tightly every day. This is a pro\ufb01t-taking strategy, looking for weakness to take us out of the market.\u201d Trade management does not always mean executing. In this case, tightening the stop reduced risk and locked in additional pro\ufb01ts on a daily basis. Even though there were no execu- tions, this is active trade management. G: \u201cWe were taken out of our long position in Silver futures yesterday, having booked a good pro\ufb01t for \ufb01ve weeks\u2019 work,\u201d and the market immediately collapsed into a dramatic sell-off. Not all trades will be this dramatic, but rather than extrap- olating the move and seeing virtually unlimited pro\ufb01ts, always consider the possibility of a collapse like this. In this case, a simple technical pattern and a very tight trailing loss allowed our clients to sell Silver the day following the high water mark for the uptrend .
