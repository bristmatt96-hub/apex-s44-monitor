Whatever the basis for the opinion, it will probably be expressed with terms such as \u201cgood chance,\u201d \u201chighly likely,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cimprobable,\u201d etc. The problem with this approach is that opinions cannot easily be expressed in numerical terms. What do we really mean by \u201cgood chance\u201d? Or by \u201chighly unlikely\u201d? If we want to approach option markets logically we will need some method of quantifying our opinions about price movements. From the elementary strategies discussed in the previous chapter it is clear that the direction in which the underlying market moves can have a significant effect on the profitability of an option strategy. Consequently, option traders are sensitive to the direction in which the underlying market moves. But an option trader has an additional problem: the speed of the market. A commodity trader who believes a commodity will rise in price within a specified period can be reasonably certain of making a profit if he is right. He simply buys the commodity, waits for it to reach his target price, then sells the commodity for a profit. The situation is not quite so simple for an option trader. Suppose a trader believes a commodity will rise in price from $100, its present price, to $120 within the next five months. Suppose also that a $110 call expiring in three months is available at a price of $4. If the commodity rises to $120 by expiration, the purchase of the $110 will result in a profit of $6 ($10 intrinsic value less the $4 cost of the option). But is this profit a Certainty? What will happen if the price of the commodity remains below $110 for the next three months and only reaches $120 after the option expires? Then the option will expire worthless and the trader will lose his $4 investment. Perhaps the trader would do better to purchase a $110 call which expires in six months rather than three months. Now he can be certain that when the commodity Teaches $120, the call will be worth at least $10 in intrinsic value. But what if the price Of the six-month option is $12? In that case the trader might still show a loss. Even though the underlying commodity reaches the target price of $120, there is no guarantee that the $110 call will ever be worth more than its $10 intrinsic value. A trader in an underlying market is almost exclusively interested in the direction IN Which the market will move. While the option trader is also sensitive to directional Considerations, he must also give careful consideration to how fast the market is likely 35 36 Chapter 3 to move. If a futures trader and an option trader take long market positions in their respective instruments, and the market does in fact move higher, the futures trader is assured of a profit while the option trader may show a loss. If the market fails to move sufficiently fast, the favorable directional move may not be enough to offset the option\u2019s loss in time value. This is the primary reason speculators generally lose in option markets. A speculator usually buys options for their seemingly favorable risk/reward characteristics (limited risk/unlimited reward). But if he purchases options, not only must he be right about market direction, he must also be right about market speed. Only if he is rignt on both counts can he expect to make a profit. If predicting the correct market direction is difficult, correctly predicting direction and speed is probably beyond most traders\u2019 capabilities. The concept of speed is vital in trading options. It is so important that there are many option strategies which depend only on the speed of the underlying market and not at all on its direction. Indeed, ifa trader is highly proficient at predicting directional moves in the underlying market, he is probably better advised to stick to the underlying instrument. It is only when he has some feel for the speed component that a trader can hope to intelligently enter the option market. The option trader who wants to intelligently evaluate the potential profitability of an option trade is faced with the task of analyzing several different factors. At a minimum he must consider: 1. The price of the underlying contract 2. The exercise price 3. The amount of time remaining to expiration 4, The direction in which he expects the underlying market to move 5. The speed at which he expects the underlying market to move Ideally, he would like to express each of these factors numerically, feed the numbers into a formula, and derive",
