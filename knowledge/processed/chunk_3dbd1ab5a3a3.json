Unless a trader knows exactly what current market conditions are, or has a great deal of confidence in the broker who will be handling the order, it is always a good practice to submit specific instructions with the order as to how it is to be filled. Additionally, when one considers all the information that must be communicated with a spread order (the expiration months, the exercise prices, the type of options, whether the order is a buy or sell, the ratio), it is easy to see Volatility Spreads 171 Figure 8-23a FUTURES ORDER Account Number Broker Memo $ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789%S BUY SELL 25 Crude O11 JantAC 125 Gude oil feb. 190 2u <\u2014 an indication of the \u2014\u00bb my . prices the broker should look at [x | \u00a320 Credit AN or None spread ratio spread price how incorrect information might inadvertently be transmitted with the order.

What categories of volatility spreads might be profitable under these conditions? By comparing prices to theoretical values, or by comparing the implied volatilities of the various options to the volatility input of 15%, we can see that all options are overpriced. Recalling the general guidelines in the last chapter, under the given conditions a trader will want to consider spreads with a negative vega: Call and Put Ratio Vertical Spreads Short Straddles and Strangles Long Butterflies Short Time Spreads Which of these categories is likely to represent the best spreading opportunity? And within each category, which specific spread might be best? CHOOSING THE BEST SPREAD For the moment, let\u2019s focus on May options only. Having eliminated the possibility of time spreads, we will have to look for spreads in the ratio vertical category (negative gamma, negative vega). With ten different May options (five calls and five puts), it is possible to construct a wide variety of spreads which fall into this category. How can we make an intelligent decision about which spread might be best? Suppose we choose three possible strategies and try to analyze them. The three strategies which have been chosen are spreads 1, 2, and 3, shown in Figure 9-2. These are certainly not the only possible spreads, nor can we be certain that they are the best possible spreads. But in theory each spread ought to be profitable under the given market conditions, since each fits into the ratio vertical spread category: spread 1 is a short straddle, spread 2 is a call ratio vertical spread, and spread 3 is a long put butterfly. How can we evaluate the relative merits of each spread? Initially it may appear that spread 1 is best since it has the greatest theoretical edge. If the volatility estimate of 15% turns out to be correct, spread 1 will show a profit of 2.86, while spread 2 will show a profit of 1.00, and spread 3 will show a profit of only 40. But is theoretical edge our only concern? If that were true we could simply do each spread in bigger and bigger size to make the theoretical edge as large as we want. Instead of doing spread 2 at 10 x 15, we might increase the size fivefold to 50 x 75.
