For example, we can initialize the elements of an array x like this: x(1)=0.1; x(2)=0.3; % 3 elements of an array initialized. % This is by default a row-vector x(3)=0.2; Note that we don\u2019t need to first \u201cdeclare\u201d this array, nor do we need to tell MATLAB its expected size beforehand. If you leave out the \u201c;\u201d sign, MATLAB will print out the result of the content of the variable being assigned a value. Any comments can be written after the \u201c%\u201d sign. If you wish, you can initialize a large number of elements en masse to a common value: % assigning the value 0.8 to all elements of a 3-vector y. This is a row-vector.y=0.8*ones(1, 3) Now if you want to do a vector addition of the two vectors, you can do it the old-fashioned way (just as you would in C), that is, using a loop: for i=1:3 z(i)=x(i)+y(i) % z is [0.9 1.1 1] end But the power of MATLAB is that it can handle many array oper- ations in parallel very succinctly, without using loops. (That\u2019s why Chan800064_bapp01.indd 200Chan800064_bapp01.indd 200 20-05-2021 21:01:5720-05-2021 21:01:57 106 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

So instead of the previous loop, you can just write z=x+y % z is the same [0.9 1.1 1] Even more powerful, you can easily select part of the different arrays and operate on them. What do you think would be the results of the following? w=x([1 3])+z([2 1]) x([1 3]) selected the first and third elements of x, so x([1 3]) is just [0.1 0.2]. z([2 1]) selected the second and first elements of y, in that order, so z([2 1]) is [1.1 0.9]. So w is [1.2 1.1]. You can delete parts of an array just as easily: x([1 3])=[] % this leaves x as [0.3] To concatenate two arrays is also trivial. To concatenate by rows, use the \u201c;\u201d to separate the arrays: u=[z([1 1]); w] % u is now % [0.9000 0.9000; % 1.2000 1.1000] To concatenate by columns, omit the \u201c;\u201d: v=[z([1 1]) w] % v is now % [0.9000 0.9000 1.2000 1.1000] Selection of a subarray can be done not only with arrays con- taining indices; it can be done with arrays containing logical values as well. For example, here is a logical array: vlogical=v<1.1 % vlogical is [1 1 0 0], where the 0s and 1's % indicate whether that element is less than 1.1 or % note. vlt=v(vlogical) % vlt is [0.9 0.9] Chan800064_bapp01.indd 201Chan800064_bapp01.indd 201 20-05-2021 21:01:5720-05-2021 21:01:57 107 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

But of course, MATLAB can deal with multidimensional arrays as well. Here is a two-dimensional example: x=[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]; % x is % 1 2 3 % 4 5 6 % 7 8 9 You can select the entire row or column of a multidimensional array by using the \u201c:\u201d symbol. For example: xr1=x(1,:) % xr1 is the first row of x, i.e. xr1 is [1 2 3] xc2=x(:, 2)% xc2 is the second column of x, i.e. xc2 is % 2 % 5 % 8 Naturally, you can delete an entire row from an array using the same method. x(1,:) =[] % x is now just [4 5 6; 7 8 9] The transpose of a matrix is indicated by a simple \u2018\u2032\u2019. So the transpose of x is just x\u2032, which is 4 7 5 8 6 9 Chan800064_bapp01.indd 202Chan800064_bapp01.indd 202 20-05-2021 21:01:5820-05-2021 21:01:58 108 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

They can be strings, or even arrays themselves. This kind of array is called cell array in MATLAB. In the following example, C is just such a cell array: C={[1 2 3]; [`a' `b' `c' `d']} % C is % [1 2 3] % `abcd' One of the beauties of MATLAB is that practically all built-in func- tions can work on all elements of arrays concurrently. For example, log(x) % this gives % 1.3863 1.6094 1.7918 % 1.9459 2.0794 2.1972 There are a large number of such built-in functions. Some of the ones I have used are: sum, cumsum, diag, max, min, mean, std, corrcoef, repmat, reshape, squeeze, sort, sortrow, rand, size, length, eigs, fix, round, floor, ceil, mod, factorial, setdiff, union, intersect, ismember, unique, any, all, eval, eye, ones, strmatch, regexp, regexprep, plot, hist, bar, scatter, try, catch,",
