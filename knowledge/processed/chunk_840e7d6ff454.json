At the risk of oversimplifying, if the market is in an established trend, the preceding setup leg should be at least as strong as previous trend legs in the same direction. In other words, it should not break the pattern of the trend and should not show momentum divergence. Pullback trades are also possible on trend changes or following breakouts of trading ranges, though this more properly falls under the Anti trade category. In these cases, there will be no established trend, but the setup leg should show a distinct change of character compared to the preceding environment. Whether in an established trend or at the beginning of a new potential trend, the same condition applies: the setup leg should suggest momentum in the market that must be resolved through an attempted third leg (impulse-retracement-impulse) continuation.

Having the level itself is not enough; it is also important to have a clear trigger against that level to support the actual entry. There are two ideal triggers. In the \ufb01rst, the market has de\ufb01ned a clean pullback. Sometimes it is possible to draw a trendline on both sides of the pullback, but, barring that, a parallel trend channel (see Chapter 3) can be used. The entry trigger is a fail- ure of this trend line or channel, followed by an immediate reversal; that is, the line is penetrated, but prices recover back above the trend line within a few bars. Conceptually, what has happened is that traders buying into the pullback against the support level have been washed out of the market by the drop below that support. Note that this will often coincide with a lower time frame climax, though this is usually clear from the trading time frame and it is not necessary to explicitly examine lower time frames in most cases. The bar marked A in Figure 6.4 shows an example of this entry in Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE: CAT). The single candle with a long shadow below the support at the bottom of the \ufb02ag is indicative of a small climax move on the lower time frame. This entry has the advantage of excellent trade location; some of these will actually be very near the low tick of the pullback. The only real disadvantage of this entry is that considerable experience may be required to read the market correctly at these spots, and, even on relatively long time frames, you have to pay attention because the exhaustion below support will happen on a single bar. This is a skilled trader\u2019s tool, not a buy-and-forget entry. The second entry trigger is actually buying against the support at the bottom of the pullback, for example, at point B in Figure 6.4. It is always possible to \ufb01nd examples of this entry on historical charts, but it can be considerably more dif\ufb01cult to make this trade in real time. Stop placement is problematic because the support can drop, washing weak-hand longs out of the market; the recovery from this fakeout is actually the pre- viously discussed entry. Why put yourself in the position of being the weak trader who is washed out of the market? However, if you are executing some variation of this buy- ing against support plan (or shorting against resistance), it is essential to limit your loss and your risk on these trades; some of them will drop support and trade lower with a vengeance. Note also that this entry has much in common with the tools and techniques P1: OTA JWBT634-c06 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 7:38 Printer: Hamilton Printing Practical Trading Templates 157 FIGURE 6.4 Two Entries in Pullbacks in an Uptrend for simply trading against any support and resistance level\u2014the same ideas, risks, and caveats apply. One pattern to avoid is buying against multiple (three or more) tests of support in a pullback, as this pattern is often more indicative of an impending failure. The opera- tive concept here is usually lower highs into support, as successive bounces \ufb01nd fewer willing buyers. This is not to say that retracement patterns that show this characteristic never work out, but, on balance, they are lower-probability plays. Most traders will have the most success if they restrict their operations to the best possible trades. The best pullbacks are pauses in strong trends; there should be enough interest in the market that the pullback does not languish too long near support or resistance. Stop There are basically two schools of thought on stop placement in general. Many traders want to put the stop as close to the pattern as possible, with the idea that doing so minimizes the size of losing trades. This is correct as far as the magnitude of the losses goes, but there are two other points to consider: First, trades should be sized so that every loss is equivalent; there is no such thing as a \u201clow risk\u201d trade.
