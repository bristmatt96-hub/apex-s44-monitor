Another way to think about poise is composure. W e want to remain composed when in the heat of tradin g and not allow the mental and emotional chatter that natu- rally emer g es in challen g in g situations to derail us in our pursuit of what matters. W e can use the terms poise and composure interchangeably . Poise and composure are closely related to focus. In fact, whenever we lose our focus, it is a key indication that we can be about to lose our com p osure. When we lose focus we become vulnerable to cognitive biases and errors. W e also become vulnerable to an emotional hijacking. Whenever emotions are allowed to take over (meanin g we allow our attention to be drawn to our internal state), we become subject to erratic tradin g behavior and poor trading performance.

Make low ratings of 1 or 2 into developmental goals using the SMART goal frame - work and be g in the necessary corrective work. 43 This PDF file is part of the audiobook TRADE MINDFULLY and cannot be sold separately.
