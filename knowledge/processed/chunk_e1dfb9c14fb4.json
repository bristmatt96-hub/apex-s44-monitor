I took the trade and set the stop. Where I fell short : Moved stop too quickly and was stopped out. What caused me to fall short : I wanted to start the week with a cushion of profi t. I didn\u2019t realize at the time that this was just another excuse to cut a profi table trade. Starting the week profi table seemed reasonable at the time. What I can do next time: Be more mindful of my thoughts. When this occurs again, I will remind myself that this is just a thought unrelated to the trade and remember that following this process is more important than the results of any individual trade.
