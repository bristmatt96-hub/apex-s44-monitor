Now we can see that spread 10 is best because its positive gamma means that a large move in the price of the underlying stock can only work to our advantage. As always, the choice of strategies will require us to make some judgements as to what risks we are willing to accept, and to what degree. Finally, let\u2019s look at our spreads with respect to a change in dividends. In our evaluation table we assumed a quarterly dividend of 1.25. Suppose we believe that the dividend is likely to be increased. How will this affect our four spreads? From Figure 9-14 we can see that now spreads 7 and 9 look the best since they are helped by an increase in the dividend. What about volatility and curvature risk? Estimating the relative risks by dividing the sensitivity by theoretical edge, we have: Vega Risk Gamma Risk Spread 7: 2.275/6.75 = 337 -32.5/6.75 = -4.8 Spread 9: 1.985/6.50= 305 -3.5/650= -\u20145 Since there is not much difference in the spreads in terms of vega risk, we might choose spread 9 since it has much less gamma risk. At the same time, if we believe an 192 Chapter 9 Figure 9-14 25 spread 8 spread 7 20- (long call time spread) (long put time spread) 107 SN spread 10 ia 54 ee TS a spread 9 wee ee (diagonal put spread) Theoretical Profit & Loss 0.00 0.50 4.00 4.50 2.00 2.50 Quarterly Dividend increase in the dividend is very likely, we may prefer spread 7, since we can see from Figure 9-14 that if the dividend is increased, spread 7 shows the greatest increase in value. WHAT IS A GOOD SPREAD? Option traders, being human, would rather talk about their successes than their disasters. If one were to eavesdrop on conversations among traders, it would probably seem that no one ever made a losing trade. Disasters, when they do occur, only happen to other traders. The fact is every successful option trader has had his share of disasters. What separates the successful trader from the unsuccessful one is the ability to survive such occurrences. Consider the trader who initiates a spread with a good theoretical edge and a large margin for error in almost every risk category. If the trader still ends up losing money on the spread, does this mean that the trader has made a poor choice of spreads? Maybe a similar spread, but one with less margin for error, would have resulted in an even greater loss, perhaps a loss from which the trader could not recover. It is impossible to take into consideration every possible risk. A spread which passed every risk test would probably have so little theoretical edge that it wouldn\u2019t be worth doing, But the trader who allows himself a reasonable margin for error will find that even his losses will not lead to financial ruin. A good spread is not necessarily the one Risk Considerations 193 that shows the greatest profit when things go well; it may be the one which shows the least loss when things go badly. Winning trades always take care of themselves. Losing trades, which don\u2019t give back all the profits from the winning ones, are just as important. ADJUSTMENTS In the last chapter we considered the question of when a trader should adjust a position to remain delta neutral. The trader must also consider how best to adjust, for there are many different ways to adjust the total delta position. An adjustment to a trader\u2019s delta position may reduce his directional risk, but if he simultaneously increases his gamma, theta, or vega risk, he may inadvertently be exchanging one type of risk for another. A delta adjustment made with the underlying contract is essentially a risk neutral adjustment. By this we mean that an adjustment made with the underlying contract will not change any of the other risks we have discussed because the gamma, theta, and vega associated with an underlying contract are zero. Therefore, if a trader wants to adjust his delta position, but wants to leave the other characteristics of the position unaffected, he can do so by purchasing or selling an appropriate number of underlying contracts. An adjustment made with options may reduce the delta risk, but will also change the other risk characteristics associated with the position. Every option, in addition to having a delta, also has a gamma, theta, and vega. When an option is added to or subtracted from a position, it necessarily changes the total delta, gamma, theta, and vega of the position. This is something which new traders sometimes forget. Consider an option market where the underlying contract is trading at 99.25. If all options appear to be overpriced, a trader might decide to sell the 95/105 strangle (sell the 95 put, sell the 105 call]. Suppose the deltas of the put and call are, respectively, \u201436 and +36, and the trader decides to sell 20 strangles. He is initially delta neutral since (~20 x -36) + {-20 x +36) = 0 Suppose several days pass and the underlying market has fallen to 97.00, with new delta values for the 95 put and 105 call of \u201441 and +30. Assuming that no adjustments have been made, the trader\u2019s delta position is now (-20 x\u201441) + (-20 x +30) = +220 If the trader now decides to make an adjustment he has three basic choices: 1. sell underlying contracts 2. sell calls 3. buy puts Which method is best? All other considerations being equal, whenever a trader makes an adjustment he should do so with the intention of improving the risk/reward characteristics of the 194 Chapter 9 position. If the trader decides to adjust his delta position by purchasing puts, he also reduces his other risks since the gamma, theta, and vega associated with the put purchase are opposite in sign to the gamma, theta, and vega",
