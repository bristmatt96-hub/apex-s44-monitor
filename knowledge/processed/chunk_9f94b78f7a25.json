If the underlying contract is below 100 the call will be worthless, but the put will act like a short underlying position, gaining one pointin value for each point the underlying contract falls. In order for the position to do no worse than break even, it must be worth at least the 6.40 we originally paid. This will occur if either the 100 call or the 100 put turns out to be worth 6.40. At expiration, the underlying contract must be at or above 106.40, or at or below 93.60. Outside of this range, the RVLIUGLL Alluiol YO aL Yl avy avu. etVy Vil al Vl VULY VY FY OL Leo LOLIBe, WiC potential profit is unlimited. Under what conditions might we initiate the position in Figure 2-7? Such a position might be sensible if we thought a large move in the underlying contract would take place in the near future, but were uncertain as to the direction of that move. If the move were sufficiently large (above 106.40 or below 93.60) the position would be profitable. Of course we might also take the opposite view, that the underlying contract was unlikely to either fall below 93.60 or rise above 106.40. Under these conditions we might prefer to sell both the 100 call and 100 put (Figure 2-8). Now our profit is limited to the total premium of 6.40, while our risk in either direction is unlimited. But if we feel strongly that the underlying contract is likely to stay in the 93.60-106.40 range through expiration, the risk might be worth taking. Suppose we take a view similar to that in Figure 2-8, that the underlying contract is unlikely to make a big move in either direction. But because there is always a chance Elementary Strategies 21 Figure 2-8 10 short a 100 call at 2.70 85 short a 100 put at 3.70 Profit Loss -10 T T T T T 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 we could be wrong, we might want to increase our margin for error by increasing our range of profitability beyond the 93.60-106.40 range. Instead of selling a 100 call and a 100 put, we might sell a 95 put for 1.55 anda 105 call for 1.15. This position (Figure 2-9) will realize its maximum profit of 2.70 anywhere within the 95-105 range, where both options will expire worthless. We won\u2019t lose money unless the underlying contract finishes below 92.30 or above 107.70 at expiration. In the former case the 95 put will be worth at least 2.70, and in the latter case the 105 call will be worth at least 2.70. There is, as always, a tradeoff for this increased range of profitability. Our maximum profit now is only 2.70, whereas in Figure 2-8 it was 6.40. In return for a reduced risk, we must be satisfied with a reduced profit potential. Option traders are constantly required to make these types of tradeoffs between risk and reward. Ifa potential reward is big enough, it may be worth taking a big risk. But if the potential reward is small, the accompanying risk should also be small. The positions in Figures 2-7, 2-8, and 2-9 all have either unlimited reward or unlimited risk because they are either net long or net short options. If we purchase and Sell equal numbers of options of the same type, we can create positions which have both limited risk and limited reward. For example, we might buy a 90 call for 9.35 and sell @ 100 call for 2.70, for a total debit of 6.65 (Figure 2-10). If the underlying contract finishes below 90.00 both options will expire worthless and we will lose our total investment of 6.65. If the underlying contract finishes above 100, the 90 call, which 22 Chapter 2 Figure 2-9 10 \u2014 85 short a 95 put at 1.55 short a 105 call at 1.15 Profit 27 92.30/ 95 } +2.70 105 \\107.70 o- | _ \u201d | | Loss 4 -10 T T T T T 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 we own, will be worth exactly 10 points more than the 100 call, and we will realize the maximum profit of 3.35. Between 90 and 100 the position will be worth some amount between zero and 10 points. In order to do no worse than break even we must recoup our original investment of 6.65. We will be able to do this if the underlying contract is at 96.65 or higher at expiration. The 90 call will then be worth at least 6.65. Like the outright purchase of a call, this position wants the market to rise so that we will realize our maximum profit of 3.35. Here, however, we are willing to give up the unlimited upside profit potential associated with the outright purchase of a 90 call, in return for the partial downside protection afforded by the sale of the 100 call. The position is bullish, but with both limited risk and limited reward. If we are bearish on the market we might create a position with limited risk and limited reward by inverting the position in Figure 2-10. That is, we might sell the 90 call and purchase the 100 call. Now our potential profit is limited to 6.65 if the market finishes below 90, and our potential loss is limited to 3.35 if the market finishes above 100. We can also create a bearish position with both limited risk and limited reward by purchasing a put with a higher exercise price and selling a put with a lower exercise price. For example, we might buy a 105 put for 7.10 and sell a 100 put for 3.70, for a total debit of 3.40 (Figure 2-11). If the underlying contract is below 100 at expiration, Elementary Strategies",
