The only way to be certain that the market will show the lower high and lower low is for the previous low to fail to hold as support. It goes without saying that these patterns are simply inverted for a downtrend chang- ing to an uptrend. In the \ufb01rst case, a downtrend fails to make a lower low, and then the trend change is con\ufb01rmed when the previous pivot high is violated. In the second case, a sharp rally takes out the previous pivot high, the subsequent decline falls short of new lows, and then the next rally makes a new high. An Important Complication: The Complex Consolidation Figure 3.29 shows an uptrending market with a complex consolidation, which is a powerful continuation pattern. Note that a naive application of the previous change-of-trend rules would have \ufb02agged a downtrend at precisely the point you should have been buying this market. This complex consolidation pattern is very common, and it often leads to exceptional trade opportunities in the direction of the existing trend. If you were to use this structure in a vacuum, you would frequently \ufb01nd yourself positioning short at precisely the point you should be buying in these complex consolidations. This does not compromise the validity of this simple labeling system, which does what it is designed to do very well: it identi\ufb01es breaks in the pattern of trends, and marks Trend change?

Go back through the last several charts, and notice how the trend changes given by each of the following tools usually lags the trend changes that you would have identi\ufb01ed by simply reading the emerging price structure in each chart. There is no right or wrong here, but there is also no holy grail. Understanding Trend Integrity For most traders, the question of trend integrity is paramount. How strong is the trend? Are there any warning signs that suggest it could turn? How far might it go? What should our expectations be when it does turn? How can we monitor the strength of the trend as it waxes and wanes, and gain some more insight into the relative buying and selling pres- sure behind the trend? These are all important questions, and they all can be addressed by some very simple analyses. There are three primary points to consider: length of swings, rate of trend, and the character of each trend leg.

If a market is gaining more on the up- swings than it is losing on the pullbacks, the net effect will be to move to a higher price level\u2014this is a very elementary de\ufb01nition of a trend and is also consistent with the Dow Theory trend construct.
