The unmoved is the source of all movement. \u2014Daodejing (ca. 6 BCE) P rice action in trends is often not that dif\ufb01cult to read, as there are a number of patterns that give insight into the integrity of the trend at any moment; trading ranges are more complicated because price action in those ranges is much more random. The de\ufb01ning patterns of trading ranges are the tests of support and resistance near the con\ufb01nes of the range, but price action around support and resistance is complex. Much of the conventional wisdom about support and resistance is not correct, and many support or resistance levels used by traders are probably no better than any random level in the market. The study of trading ranges must begin with a careful look at support and resistance, with a willingness to question some long-held beliefs about these levels. SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE In their venerable bible of technical analysis, Edwards and Magee (1948; 4th ed., 1964) de\ufb01ne support as \u201cthe price level at which a suf\ufb01cient amount of demand is forthcoming to stop, and possibly turn higher for a time, a downtrend\u201d; they give the inverse de\ufb01nition for resistance. The idea is that, as price declines, lower prices will naturally \ufb01nd more willing buyers. At some point, price declines far enough that buyers are willing to soak up all the sell orders in the market, and the market will stop going down. This theoretical concept is sound, but there is another important point to consider: real markets have so many competing in\ufb02uences and so much noise that prices frequently stop at random levels. That, coupled with our innate tendency to \ufb01nd patterns in random data, can cause support and resistance areas to appear on charts for no signi\ufb01cant reason. 97 P1: OTA JWBT634-c04 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 7:30 Printer: Hamilton Printing On Trading Ranges 99 A B FIGURE 4.1 Resistance Becomes Support intraday charts of Baidu, Inc.

It is common to see price penetrate a level just enough to lure traders into making the wrong decisions at these points. In this case, shorts using the level to manage their risk would have likely bought to cover, as it seemed resistance was failing; this type of action and reversal is often a catalyst for a strong move when the trapped traders panic out of their positions. Last, Figure 4.4 shows an example in which a level was engaged nine times in the space of two trading days, holding cleanly on all but two of the tests. These are textbook examples of price action around support and resistance levels, but there is one small problem: the levels in these examples are random price levels! These are not actual support and resistance levels; they were drawn by hiding the price bars and randomly drawing lines on the chart without regard to prices or market struc- ture. (This was done on a live video available at http://adamhgrimes.com/blog/2011/12/04/ randomsrlevels/) You can, and should, reproduce this experiment yourself. This is an ex- periential process\u2014you must actually do this yourself, ideally several times.
