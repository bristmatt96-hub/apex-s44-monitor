Because of its relatively minor importance, we will generally disregard the rho in analyzing option strategies and managing risk. SUMMARY It is important for the active option trader to become familiar with delta, gamma, theta, and vega characteristics, since he may need to make quick decisions about trading strategies and risk management, decisions which might well determine his financial fate. The following is a summary of these characteristics: Delta\u2014Deltas range from zero for far out-of-the-money calls to 100 for deeply in-the-money calls, and from zero for far out-of-the-money puts to -100 for deeply in-the-money puts. At-the-money calls have deltas of approximately 50, and at-the-money puts approximately -50. As time passes, or as we decrease our volatility assumption, call deltas move away from 50, and puts deltas away from \u2014SO. As we increase our volatility assumption, call deltas move towards 50, and put deltas towards -50. Gamma\u2014At-the-money options have greater gammas than either in- or out-of-the-money options with otherwise identical contract specifications.

Theta\u2014At-the-money options have greater thetas than either in- or out-of the-money options with otherwise identical contract specifications. The theta of an at-the-money option increases as expiration approaches. A short-term, at-the-money option will always decay more quickly than a long-term, at-the-money option. As we increase (decrease) our volatility assumption, the theta of an option will rise (fall). Higher volatility means there is greater time value associated with the option, so that each day\u2019s decay will also be greater when no movement occurs. Vega\u2014aAt-the-money options have greater vegas than either in- or out-of the-money options with otherwise identical contract specifications. Out-of-the-money options have the greatest vega as a percent of theoreti- cal value. 120 Chapter 6 The vegas of all options decrease as time to expiration grows shorter. A long-term option is always more sensitive to a change in volatility than a short-term option with otherwise identical contract specifications. The vega of an at-the-money option is relatively constant with respect to changes in volatility. If we raise or lower volatility, the option\u2019s vega is unlikely to change significantly. In Figure 6-3 we summarized the general effects on stock option values if the expected dividend payment for the underlying stock changes. But we did not address the question of magnitude. How sensitive is an option\u2019s value to a change in dividends? When a stock goes ex-dividend, its price will normally drop by approximately the amount of the dividend. Increasing the dividend is therefore similar to dropping the stock price, and cutting the dividend is similar to increasing the stock price. If a stock had been expected to pay a dividend of $.75 per share, and the dividend is increased to $1.00 per share, this is similar to dropping the stock price by an additional $.25. Since an option\u2019s sensitivity to a change in the price of the underlying is given by the delta, the sensitivity to a change in the dividend can also be approximated by the delta. If the dividend is increased by $.25, a call with a delta of 60 will lose about $.15 in value. A put with a delta of \u201440 wilt gain about $.10. This approximation applies only when one dividend payment is expected prior to expiration. If multiple dividend payments are expected over the life of the option, the effect on the option\u2019s value must be increased accordingly. As we will see, dividend considerations play their greatest role in arbitrage strategies and early exercise. Two typical evaluation tables with prices, implied volatilities, and all relevant sensitivities are shown in Figures 6-24 and 6-25, Figure 6-24 is for options on September Deutschemark futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as of 22 May 1992. The values are based on a volatility assumption of 10.5% and an interest rate assumption of 4.50%. Figure 6-25 is for options on General Electric stock on the Chicago Board Options Exchange as of the same date. The values are based on a volatility assumption of 22% and an interest rate assumption of 4.50% for all three expiration months (June, September, December). The expected dividends for General Electric stock, and their payment dates, are also included in the assumptions.\u201d We noted previously that the delta, gamma, theta, and vega can be sensitive to changes in volatility. Under some circumstances it may be useful for a trader to ask: if the implied volatility of an option were the correct volatility, what would be its delta, gamma, theta, and vega? The resulting numbers are referred to as the implied delta, gamma, theta, and vega. The implied delta and theta, in particular, often appear on computer printouts, the former because many traders prefer to maintain delta neutral 6. This is a simplified example with uniform volatility and interest rates. Under some circumstances it might be more reasonable to vary the volatility and Interest rate assumptions for different expiration dates. 7.
