Last, it is worth mentioning that there is a third possibility for price action around po- tential support and resistance areas, which is no action at all. The market may approach a level and trade through it with no pause or unusual price action; the anticipated level simply was not there, and, if we have not planned for the possibility that the level simply does not exist, it is easy to be taken by surprise. Plan for every possibility and actively work to reduce potential surprises that can unbalance you and lead to poor decisions. TRADING RANGES AS FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES Markets tend to alternate between trending periods and trading ranges. In trends, prices continue moving in the same direction. Because these trends are driven by an imbalance of buying or selling pressure, price movements are somewhat persistent and more pre- dictable in terms of direction, magnitude, and timing. Trading ranges are directionless areas where the market is in relative equilibrium. In these spots, price action is much GS - 1 S min Goldman Sachs Group 180.00 178.00 176.00 174.00 172.00 170.00 168.00 166.00 164.00 9/8 12:00 9/9 12:00 9/10 9/11 9/14 9/15 9/16 9/17 56 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

The weekly was overextended, and daily price action suggested a certain lack of conviction at the highs. Again, to show that this isn\u2019t hindsight analysis, here is what I wrote in my morning report on April 26, 2010, the point marked A on the daily chart: \u201cThe market [may be] vulnerable so that when a shock \ufb01nally does hit, the effect may be out of all reasonable proportion. This is why we are focusing attention on \ufb01nding a good spot to enter a countertrend trade. ... Today, we have a potential trade setup in the S&P 500 index. If the index closes below the previous YTD high ... we will be short.\u201d This turned out to be the exact high of the market for many months, and we were fortunate to cover the last of that short a few days later, near the lows on the day of the Flash Crash. It is also worth mentioning that there are many cases in which it is not so simple to make a directional call. Though we have just looked at several good examples, realize that they are best-case situations. Sometimes it is not possible to make any kind of di- rectional call, and traders have no justi\ufb01cation for taking a position. In these cases it is appropriate to stay \ufb02at (to have no position) and to wait for further clari\ufb01cation before making a trade. 1,400.00 1,300.00 1,200.00 1,100.00 '\u00b7,,,_ 1,000.00 800.00 Oct Nov Dec Oct '09 57 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

The Edwards and Magee crowd will recognize more than a dozen variations of trading ranges, but, to me, they are all the same. They all ful\ufb01ll one of two functions in the higher time frame, and they are all noisy patterns roughly bounded by support and resistance. Why clutter a sim- ple model with unnecessary variations, quali\ufb01cations, and conditions? Visually, the most important factor in distinguishing between different types of ranges is what is happening with the edges of the range. Is the range contained by parallel lines, are the edges con- verging, or are they expanding? Each of these may have some subtle differences, with some effect on the expected resolution of the patterns. Parallel Ranges: The Box The simplest range is one that trades between parallel prices in a box formation; volatility is relatively constant for the duration of the range. On the lower time frame, we will see trends (it is a little-known fact that many of the best",
