U nderstanding Your M ind PART I 9 Colin had been watching the S&P e\u2010mini futures all morning, waiting patiently for a trade. Finally, he saw one setup. He looked carefully at both the price ac- tion and the indicators he used to qualify his trades. Everything met his criteria. Price had turned bullish and all indicators were signaling long. \u201cThere\u2019s no fl aw in the setup,\u201d he thought. The trade started working almost immediately. The market moved up smartly, breaking a nearby resistance level and then moved into \u201cclear air\u201d where no other resistance was located. The S&Ps rallied for twelve points from the trade entry\u2014an excellent intrada y run for this market. But, Colin was not on board. He didn\u2019t take the trade. When discussin g this later, he said, \u201cThe same setup occurred yesterday. I guess I was thinking of that trade, which I took, but it didn\u2019t work out. I had a loss. There was even a slight difference in favor of to- day\u2019s trade. One of the indicators did not confi rm yesterday. Today\u2019s setup was picture\u2010perfect. I kicked myself for not taking the trade. I don\u2019t really understand why I didn\u2019t take it. I wasn\u2019t feeling any big emotions; I certainly wasn\u2019t fearful. I just thou ght that since yesterday\u2019s trade failed, this one would, too. I was wrong. Why didn\u2019t I take the trade?\u201d W h at f ai l e d Co l in was not h is emotions or misrea d in g t h e mar k et. W h at f ai l e d Colin was his thinkin g .

W e ask a question that is easy to answer: Does this look like a bull fl ag? The correc t question is: W h at is t h e l i k e ly next move o f t h e mar k et? T h e eas y answer to t h e eas y question h as us ta k in g a l on g position. T h e correct question was never as k e d b ecause it requires more involved thinkin g . The correct question may lead us to the conclu - sion that the market is overbou g ht, has stalled at a hi g her time frame resistance level, an d w h at initia ll y l oo k e d l i k e a b u ll fl ag is now seen as a mar k et una bl e to ra ll y f ar- t h er an d a b out to f a ll .
