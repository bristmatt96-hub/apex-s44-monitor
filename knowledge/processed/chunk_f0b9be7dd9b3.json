In addition, I have developed two major education programs which build on the foundation methodology of volume price analysis for specific markets. The first of these is The Complete Stock Trading And Investing Program, and the second is The Complete Forex Trading Program. Both are extremely comprehensive with a vast library of videos, podcasts, and online PDFs, along with a full package of trading indicators, many of which are volume based. You can find all the details for both programs at https://quantumtradingeducation.com and I hope to see you in the VPA traders room hosted by myself and my husband David, which is exclusively for students on either program. My Other Books Stock Trading & Investing Using Volume Price Analysis If you enjoyed reading A Complete Guide To Volume Price Analysis, then you'll love this one too, which is the perfect companion book, and one I wrote following hundreds of emails asking for a follow up to the first. Stock Trading & Investing Using V olume Price Analysis, takes the VPA principles and builds into a comprehensive workbook of over 200 examples. The examples presented are drawn primarily from US stock markets, but also include others from the futures markets such as indices, commodities, currency futures and bonds. Each chart is fully annotated to illustrate and highlight key points in the associated text, and together provide a detailed and comprehensive study of the volume price relationship, giving clear signals as to where the stock is going next. Find it on my site at https://annacoulling.com Forex For Beginners As a trader and investor with over twenty five years of experience, I wrote Forex For Beginners with one clear objective in mind. To provide a clear, detailed and unequivocal guide to this market and how to trade it. The marketing hype that embraces the forex world has two very simple messages. First, it's easy to get started and second, it's easy to make money with little effort. The first of these statements is certainly true. The second is not. Forex is a complex market that sits at the heart of all the financial markets, and to succeed requires a deeper understanding than would first appear. This is why so many struggle and ultimately fail. From the many five star reviews on Amazon, it seems I have achieved my goal in providing new and novice forex traders with a foundation course for trading forex and on which to build.
