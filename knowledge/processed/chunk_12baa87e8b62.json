The situation is not clear-cut, and the answer will probably depend on a trader\u2019s experience in the market. If he feels that an increase in implied volatility represents the greatest risk, he will probably choose spread 4. If he feels that a large move in the underlying contract represents the greatest risk, he will probably choose spread 5. And if he is willing to settle for partial protection against both volatility and market movement, he will probably choose spread 6. As must by now be obvious, the choice of spreads is never a simple matter of right and wrong. Like all trading decisions, it is a question of risk and reward. While there are Many risks with which an option trader must deal, he will often have to ask himself which risk represents the greatest threat. Sometimes, in order avoid one type of risk, he will be forced to accept a different risk. Even if the trader is willing to accept some risk in a certain area, he may decide that he will only do so to a limited degree. Then he may have to accept increased risks in other areas. If given the choice between several different spreads a trader can use a Computer, as was done in the foregoing examples, to study the risk characteristics of the different spreads. Unfortunately, it may not always be possible to analyze the choices in such detail. A trader may not have the necessary computer support at his disposal, or market conditions may be changing so rapidly that if he fails to make an immediate decision opportunity may quickly pass him by. Is there any way to make a quick comparison of spreads without doing a detailed graphic analysis? 186 Chapter 9 One method that traders sometimes use is to think of every spread as a tradeoff between risk and reward. We might express this tradeoff as a fraction, risk/reward. If a trader goes into the marketplace, he would like to have the greatest possible reward. At the same time he would like to have the least possible risk. Indeed, the ideal risk/reward fraction would be 0 + @ (zero risk, infinite reward}. But 0 + \u00a9 = 0, so that if we express the risk/reward characteristics of each spread as a fraction, risk/reward, then in theory the spread whose fraction is closest to zero has the best tradeoff between risk and reward. What numbers should we use to express the risk and reward for a spread? The reward is what we expect to make when we are right about market conditions. This is simply the theoretical edge, and we can therefore make the theoretical edge the denominator of our fraction. What about the numerator, or risk component? Here we may have to deal with several different numbers since option positions are subject to many different risks. These risks are represented by the various option sensitivities. The practical approach is to express the numerator of our fraction with the sensitivity with which we are most concerned. For example, if a change in volatility is our greatest concer, we can use the vega of the spread as our numerator. If choosing from among several different spreads, the spread whose vega/theoretical edge is closest to zero will have the most desirable risk/reward characteristics. In the same way, if a large price move is our greatest concern, the spread whose gamma/theoretical edge is closest to zero will have the most desirable risk/reward characteristics. Let\u2019s try to analyze spreads 4, 5, and 6 using this method. One risk with which we will certainly have to be concerned is the possibility of a change in volatility. Calculating the vega/theoretical edge, we have: Spread 4: -.840/2.70 = -311 Spread 5: -1.850/3.00 = -.617 Spread 6: ~1.340/2.90 = -.462 From the above calculations we can see that spread 4 has the best volatility characteristics since its vega/theoretical edge is closest to zero. This is the same conclusion we reached from Figure 9-8, but without the necessity of doing a detailed study of each spread. Note that when we divide the sensitivity of a spread by its theoretical value, the result is independent of the size of the spread. If we had done spread 4 twice as large (40 x 60 instead of 20 x 30) this would have doubled the size of both the vega and the theoretical edge. The resulting",
