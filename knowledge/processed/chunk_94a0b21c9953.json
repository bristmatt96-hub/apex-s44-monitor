Similarly, when a company issued a dividend $d per share with an ex-date of T, all the prices before T need to be multiplied by the number (Close(T \u2013 1) \u2013 d)/Close(T \u2013 1), where Close(T \u2013 1) is the closing price of the trading day before T. Notice that I adjust the historical prices by a multiplier instead of sub- tracting $d so that the historical daily returns will remain the same pre- and post-adjustment. This is the way Yahoo! Finance adjusts its historical data, and is the most common way. (If you adjust by subtracting $d instead, the historical daily changes in prices will be the same pre- and postadjustment, but not the daily returns.) If the historical data are not adjusted, you will find a drop in price at the ex-date\u2019s market open from previous day\u2019s close (apart from normal market fluctuation), which may trigger an erroneous trad- ing signal. I recommend getting historical data that are already split and dividend adjusted, because otherwise you would have to find a sepa- rate historical database of splits and dividends and apply the adjust- ments yourself\u2014a somewhat tedious and error-prone task, which I will describe in the following example. Example 3.2: Adjusting for Splits and Dividends Here we look at IGE, an ETF that has had both splits and dividends in its history. It had a 2:1 split on June 9, 2005 (the ex-date). Let\u2019s look at the unadjusted prices around that date (you can download the historical prices of IGE from Yahoo! Finance into an Excel spreadsheet): Date Open High Low Close 6/10/2005 73.98 74.08 73.31 74 6/9/2005 72.45 73.74 72.23 73.74 6/8/2005 144.13 146.44 143.75 144.48 6/7/2005 145 146.07 144.11 144.11 We need to adjust the prices prior to 6/9/2005 due to this split. This is easy: N = 2 here, and all we need to do is to multiply those prices by 1/2. The following table shows the adjusted prices: Chan800064_c03.indd 42 6/7/2021 2:04:49 PM 11 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

Backtesting 43 Date Open High Low Close 6/10/2005 73.98 74.08 73.31 74 6/9/2005 72.45 73.74 72.23 73.74 6/8/2005 72.065 73.22 71.875 72.24 6/7/2005 72.5 73.035 72.055 72.055 Now, the astute reader will notice that the adjusted close prices here do not match the adjusted close prices displayed in the Yahoo! Finance table. The reason for this is that there have been dividends distributed after 6/9/2005, so the Yahoo! prices have been adjusted for all those as well. Since each adjustment is a multiplier, the aggregate adjustment is just the product of all the individual multipliers. Here are the divi- dends from 6/9/2005 to November 2007, together with the unadjusted closing prices of the previous trading days and the resulting individual multipliers: Ex-Date Dividend Prev Close Multiplier 9/26/2007 0.177 128.08 0.998618 6/29/2007 0.3 119.44 0.997488 12/21/2006 0.322 102.61 0.996862 9/27/2006 0.258 91.53 0.997181 6/23/2006 0.32 92.2 0.996529 3/27/2006 0.253 94.79 0.997331 12/23/2005 0.236 89.87 0.997374 9/26/2005 0.184 89 0.997933 6/21/2005 0.217 77.9 0.997214 (Check out the multipliers yourself on Excel using the formula I gave above to see if they agree with my values here.) So the aggregate multi- plier for the dividends is simply 0.998618 \u00d7 0.997488 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 0.997214 = 0.976773. This multiplier should be applied to all the unadjusted prices on or after 6/9/2005. The aggregate multiplier for the dividends and the split is 0.976773 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.488386, which should be applied to all the unadjusted prices before 6/9/2005. So let\u2019s look at the resulting adjusted prices after applying these multipliers: Chan800064_c03.indd 43 6/7/2021 2:04:49 PM 12 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

We already covered this issue in Chapter 2. Unfortunately, databases that are free from survivorship bias are quite expensive and may not be affordable for a startup business. One way to overcome this problem is to start collecting point-in-time data yourself for the ben- efit of your future backtest. If you save the prices each day of all the stocks in your universe to a file, then you will have a point-in-time or survivorship-bias-free database to use in the future. Another way to lessen the impact of survivorship bias is to backtest your strategies on more recent data so that the results are not distorted by too many missing stocks.

But, of course, when you are reading this, IGE will likely have distributed more divi- dends and may have even split further, so your Yahoo! table won\u2019t look like the one above. It is a good exercise to check that you can make further adjust- ments based on those dividends and splits that result in the same adjusted prices as your current Yahoo! table.
