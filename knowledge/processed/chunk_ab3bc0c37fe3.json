For example, log(x) % this gives % 1.3863 1.6094 1.7918 % 1.9459 2.0794 2.1972 There are a large number of such built-in functions. Some of the ones I have used are: sum, cumsum, diag, max, min, mean, std, corrcoef, repmat, reshape, squeeze, sort, sortrow, rand, size, length, eigs, fix, round, floor, ceil, mod, factorial, setdiff, union, intersect, ismember, unique, any, all, eval, eye, ones, strmatch, regexp, regexprep, plot, hist, bar, scatter, try, catch, circshift, datestr, datenum, isempty, isfinite, isnan, islogical, randperm If the built-in functions of the basic MATLAB platform do not meet all your needs, you can always purchase additional toolboxes from MATLAB. I will discuss some of them as follows. There is also a newer data structure in MATLAB called \u201ctables\u201d that I found very useful. (It is very similar to Python\u2019s Pandas Data- frames, in case any Python programmers are reading this.) Tables are arrays that come with column headings and possibly dates for rows, so you don\u2019t need to remember that, for example, cell (1562, 244) refers to the closing price of Tesla on October 23, 2020. Instead, you can retrieve that price by writing: TT{\u201923-Oct-2020\u2019, \u2018TSLA\u2019} Tables and timetables make for some powerful simplifications in manipulating time series data that has two dimensions (called panel Chan800064_bapp01.indd 203Chan800064_bapp01.indd 203 20-05-2021 21:01:5820-05-2021 21:01:58 109 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

For example, you can use the synchronize function to quickly merge the P&L table and the capital allocation table, automatically aligning their dates. You can also use the retime function to convert daily P&Ls to monthly P&Ls with a single line of code. Some of the toolboxes useful to quantitative traders are Optimi- zation, Global Optimization (when you don\u2019t want to get stuck in a local minima/maxima and want to try simulated annealing or genetic algorithms), Statistics and Machine Learning (that\u2019s the most useful toolbox for me), Deep Learning, Signal Processing (technical indica- tors are but a small subset of signal processing functions), Financial (for backtesting!), Financial Instruments (good for options pricing, backing out implied volatility etc.), Econometrics (GARCH, ARIMA, VAR, and all the techniques you need for financial time series analysis), Datafeed (to retrieve data from IQFeed, Quandl, etc., eas- ily), and Trading (to send orders to Interactive Brokers, TT, or even FIX). These toolboxes typically cost only about $50 each for a home user. If they still do not meet all your needs, there are also a number of free user-contributed toolboxes available for download from the internet. I have introduced one of them in this book: the Economet- rics toolbox developed by James LeSage (www.spatial-econometrics .com). There are a number of others that I have used before such as the Bayes Net toolbox from Kevin Murphy (github.com/ bayesnet /bnt). The easy availability of these user-contributed toolboxes and the large community of MATLAB users from whom you can ask for help greatly enhance the usefulness of MATLAB as a computa- tional platform. You can, of course, write your own functions in MATLAB, too. I have given a number of example functions in this book, all of which can be downloaded from my website, www.epchan.com /book. In fact, it is very helpful for you to develop your own library of utilities functions that you often use for constructing trading strategies. As this homegrown library grows, your productivity in developing new strategies will increase as well.
