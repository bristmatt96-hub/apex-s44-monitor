But if you are serious about succeeding as a full time forex trader, or perhaps improving your current returns, this is the book for you. Many aspiring forex traders fail to understand where this market sits in the hierarchy of the capital markets, and are surprised to find it is the axis on which the others rotate. This is no surprise since all markets are about risk and return. Money chasing higher returns but with higher risk and lower returns coupled with lower risk. The foreign exchange market is the sluice gate through which market sentiment and money flow are reflected. When sentiment changes in one market it is instantly reflected in another, and the book details all these linkages and relationships. The relational aspects are then blended with a deep understanding of both fundamental and technical analysis to provide a complete three dimensional approach to forex trading.
