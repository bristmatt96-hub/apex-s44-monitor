Such a market can he easily identified by comparing our volatility estimate to the implied volatility in the option marketplace. If implied volatility is generally lower than our volatility estimate, all options will appear underpriced. If implied volatility is generally higher than our estimate, all options will appear overpriced. If options generally appear underpriced (low implied volatility), look for spreads with a positive vega. This includes strategies in the backspread or long time spread category. Jf options generally appear overpriced (high implied volatility), look for spreads with a negative vega. This includes strategies in the ratio vertical or short time spread category. It may seem at first glance that if one encounters a market where all options are either underpriced or overpriced, the sensible strategies are either long straddles and strangles, or short straddles and strangles. Such strategies will enable a trader to take a position with a positive theoretical edge on both sides of the spread. Straddles and strangles are certainly possible strategies when all options are too cheap or too expen- sive. We will see in Chapter 9 that straddles and strangles, while often having a large, positive theoretical edge, can also be among the riskiest of all strategies. For this reason, a trader will often want to consider other spreads in the backspread or ratio vertical spread category, even if such spreads entail buying some overvalued options or selling some underpriced options. The theoretical values and deltas in Figure 8-20 have been reproduced in Figures 8-21 and 8-22, but now prices have been included which reflect implied volatilities different from the volatility input of 20%. The prices in Figure 8-21 reflect an implied volatility of 17%. In this case the reader will find that only those spreads with a positive vega will have a positive theoretical value: call and put backspreads long straddles and strangles Volatility Spreads 167 Figure 8-21 March Futures = 100.00 IMPLIED VOLATILITY = 17% Time to",
