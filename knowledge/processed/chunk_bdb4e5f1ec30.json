Normally, this factor increases with each bar, moving the stop closer at an ever-accelerating rate. accumulation One of the classic market phases in which large buyers establish posi- tions without moving the market, but also can refer to the presence of underlying buy- ing in other contexts. Accumulation is usually seen as constructive and supportive of prices. adaptive markets hypothesis (AMH) A theory of market behavior pioneered by Andrew Lo that proposes that markets can be described by a process of evolving ef\ufb01ciency. always-in A colloquialism for styles of trading that seek to always have a position in the market, reversing from long to short based on technical signals. Perhaps more useful as a research/backtesting methodology than an actual trading style. Anti A trade setup that attempts to enter the \ufb01rst pullback following a potential change of trend. ask Also called the offer. The price, almost always above the bid and often above the last print, in an order book at which people are willing to sell the market. asynchronous trading A problem in evaluating indexes, pairs trades, or some systems in which prices that occur together in the data series may not have actually occurred at the same time. ATR% Average True Range (ATR) as a percentage of the last price, or ATR standardized for price. This is a volatility measure that can be compared across assets with different price levels. autocorrelation The correlation of a time series to itself at different time points, as a function of the time between them. Autocorrelation can often cause trends in price series. Average Directional Index (ADX)/Directional Movement Index (DMI) Technical indicators that measure strength of trend. average range A simple volatility measure that averages the range of a set of bars. In practice, Average True Range (ATR) is more commonly used to capture overnight gaps, but average range may be more applicable in some intraday applications. Average True Range (ATR) A measure of volatility. True range is the bar\u2019s range (high minus low) plus any overnight gap from the previous bar\u2019s close. 427 177 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

This is a complex and involved process; many traders who attempt it make some critical errors. basis point One hundredth of a percent. 1 basis point (bp) = 0.01 percent. bell curve An informal term for the shape of the normal distribution curve. bid In \ufb01nancial markets, the price, often below the last price and always below the offer, where buyers are willing to purchase the asset. binomial tree A useful tool in understanding random walks. A visual representation of the possible values a random walk or asset price could take at various steps in time. black boxes A term usually reserved for completely computerized and rule-based trad- ing systems. breakout trades A class of trades that seeks to enter on moves above resistance or be- low support, looking for continuation in the direction of the break. Equity-centric traders are more likely to use the term breakdown for a move below support; futures traders tend to use breakout for both trades. candlestick chart A type of chart that pictures the space between the open and the close of a period as an empty or full rectangle, depending on whether the close was higher or lower than the open, with thin \u201cshadows\u201d extending to the high and low of the period. capital asset pricing model (CAPM) A model to determine the theoretical price of an asset as a function of the risk-free rate and market return. CAPM was an important step in the evolution of academic thinking about markets, but has little, if any, utility in actual practice. causation In \ufb01nancial markets, it is very dif\ufb01cult to determine causative links between markets and exogenous factors. Classically, researchers in other \ufb01elds try to isolate po- tential causative factors to understand their in\ufb02uence, but this is dif\ufb01cult to do in market settings. It is important to avoid assumptions and to learn to think carefully about this important issue. central limit theorem A theorem that informally states that the outcome of many ran- dom events will tend",
