She had developed good technical skills and was a net profi table trader. Al - though enjoying success and profi ts, Jenna could be a better trader than her re- sults refl ected. What held her back was that she did not know that she frequently committed similar errors. For example, Jenna liked to test her refl exes at the be- ginning of the trading day by putting on an aggressive trade to see how she and the market responded. Being aggressive, these trades often went against her. At times, the market went swiftly through her mental stop. When this occurred, she froze and took a much greater loss than anticipated. This would adversely affect her trading the rest of the morning, making her much more cautious. Like many traders, at the end of the day Jenna recorded her trades. She never made more than a cursory review of her trades or her performance fo r that day, however. Therefore, she was blind to the fact that she was making the same errors over an d over again. Not only was she committing trading errors described above, she was also committing an error with respect to process.
