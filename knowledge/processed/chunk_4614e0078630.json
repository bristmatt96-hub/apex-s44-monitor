Concept Breakouts are an important class of trades and can give rise to strong price moves beyond the breakout point. Schematically, there are three places to enter break- out trades: before, after, or on the breakout. Trades entered on the breakout can incur high slippage and poor trade location due to the high volatility and low liquidity that ac- company many of these trades; many traders \ufb01nd better success with executing either before or after the actual breakout. We will \ufb01rst look at some characteristic patterns pre- ceding good breakouts in which the market tips its hand and shows that energy is being built up to support the breakout. (Think classic accumulation.) It is possible to enter in these formations preceding the breakout in order to have better trade location and to sidestep the potential slippage. Setup Unfolding price action creates many potential support and resistance levels in the market. Most of these are insigni\ufb01cant\u2014most support and resistance levels are noth- ing more than mirages. However, a very small set of these levels become extremely im- portant, and, when violated, the pressure gives rise to a strong move beyond the level. For breakout trades, this is the \ufb01rst and most important condition: you must identify one of these signi\ufb01cant levels that is likely to give good action when broken. If you are work- ing with these levels and their accompanying formations, entering the trades properly, and managing them appropriately, breakout trades can be relatively easy. If you attempt breakout trades at insigni\ufb01cant levels and without a good plan, consistent losses will erode your trading account. Good breakout levels are usually levels that are clearly visible to all market partic- ipants. For instance, there are levels that have been tested cleanly multiple times, and it is obvious to even a casual chart reader that price has been unable to penetrate the level. This creates trading opportunities because some traders will make decisions when price eventually does get through the level. Whether they are stopping out of existing positions, taking pro\ufb01ts, or entering on the breakouts does not matter; what does matter is that there will be additional volume and order \ufb02ow when this important price level is P1: OTA JWBT634-c06 JWBT634-Grimes May 10, 2012 7:38 Printer: Hamilton Printing Practical Trading Templates 175 FIGURE 6.15 A Very Clean Breakout Level in XOMA violated. Figure 6.15 shows an example of a very clean level that set up a good intraday breakout in XOMA Ltd (Nasdaq: XOMA). On daily and higher time frames, it is unusual to see perfectly clear levels, but signif- icant and visible support or resistance can still set up good breakout trades. Figure 6.16 shows an example of a typical breakout level on a daily chart, here illustrated in the stock of Cree, Inc. (Nasdaq: CREE). There are two other points to consider on this chart: First, penetrations of levels before the breakout usually seem to expend some of the energy behind the breakout, and often lead to poor trades. The key question is how long and how signi\ufb01cant these penetrations through the level were. In Figure 6.16, the level was not perfectly clean, but there was no signi\ufb01cant price action above the level preceding the breakout, only small and short-lived failure tests. Second, the actual breakout entry was a gap through the resistance level, which brings some execution challenges to the table. Many traders will be tempted to skip these trades, as they will be forced to enter at signi\ufb01cantly higher prices than they had planned, and will be exposed to the danger of a gap failure. This is a mistake because a gap through an important level usually hints at a powerful shift in market dynamics. Some of the best breakouts are \u201cgap and go\u201d trades that open beyond the level and never look back.
