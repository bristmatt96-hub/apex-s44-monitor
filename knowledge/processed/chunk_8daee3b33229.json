  "content": "we took a very simple situation with only five possible price outcomes, each with identical probability. What changes might we make in order to develop a more realistic model? For one thing, we would have to know the settlement procedure for the option. In the United States, all options are subject to stock-type settlement, which requires full payment for the option. If the $100 call will have an expected return of $6 at expiration, we will have to deduct the carrying costs to get its value today. If interest rates are 12% annually (1% per month) and the option will expire in two months, we will have to discount the $6 expected return by the 2% carrying cost, or about 12\u00a2. The theoretical value of the option will then be $5.88. What other factors might we have to consider? We assumed that all five price outcomes were equally likely. Is this a realistic assumption? Suppose you were told that only two possible prices were possible at expiration, $110 and $250. With the underlying contract at $100 today, which do you think is more likely? Based on experience, most traders would probably agree that extreme price changes which are far away from today\u2019s price are less likely than small changes which remain close to today\u2019s price. For this reason, $110 is more likely than $250. To take this into consideration, perhaps our price outcomes, in terms of probability, ought to be concen- trated around the present price of the underlying contract. Such a distribution is shown in Figure 3-2. Now the expected return from a $100 call is: (10% x 0) +(20% x 0) +(40% x 0) +(20% x $10) +(10% x $20} = $4.00 If, as before, the option is subject to stock-type settlement and carrying costs are 2%, the theoretical value of the option will now be $3.92. Note that in Figure 3-2 all outcomes and probabilities are arranged symmetrically. Even though the new probabilities altered the expected return for the $100 call, the expected return from any position taken in the underlying contractis still zero. For each upward price move, there isa downward move of equal magnitude and probability. We Might, however, believe that the expected return to an underlying contract is not zero, that there is a greater chance that the contract will move one direction rather than another. Look at the price outcomes and probabilities in Figure 3-3. Using these new probabilities, the expected return from a long position in the underlying contract is: \u2014(10% x $20} -(20% x $10) +(30% x 0) +(25% x $10) +(15% x $20) = +$1.50 and the expected return for the $100 call is: (10% x 0) +(20% x 0) +(30% x 0) +(25% x $10) +(15% x $20) = +$5.50 42 Chapter 3 Figure 3-2 $80 $90 $100 $110 $120 10% 20% 40% 20% 10% Figure 3-3 $80 $90 $100 $110 $120 10% 20% 30% 25% 15% Note that the underlying contract now has a positive expected return, so it may seem that there is money to be made simply by purchasing the underlying contract. This would be true if there were no other considerations. But suppose the underlying contract is a stock, and therefore subject to stock-type settlement. If we purchase the stock at today\u2019s price of $100 and hold it for some period, there is a carrying cost associated with the investment. If the carrying cost is exactly equal to the expected return of $1.50, we will just break even. For a long stock position to be profitable, the stock must appreciate by at least the amount of carrying costs over the holding period. Therefore, the expected return from the stock must be some positive number. If we assume that any stock trade will just break even, the expected return must be equal to the carrying costs. Some stocks also pay dividends. If the dividend is paid during the holding period, it will affect the expected return. A trader who buys stock will have to pay out carrying costs, but he will receive the dividends. If we again assume that a stock trade will break even, the expected return at the end of the holding period must be identical to the carrying costs less the dividend. If the carrying cost for the stock over some period is $3.50, and a $1.00 dividend is expected during this period, the expected return at the end of the period must be $2.50. A trader who purchases the stock today will incur an interest debit of $3.50 at the end of the holding period, but this will be exactly offset by the $1.00 dividend which he receives during the holding period,* as well as the $2.50 expected return at the end of the period. Inan arbitrage-free market, where no profit can be made by either buying or selling acontract, all credits and debits, including the expected return, must exactly cancel out. If we assume an arbitrage-free market, we must necessarily assume that the forward price, the average price of the contract at the end of the holding period, is the current price, plus an expected return which will exactly offset all other credits and debits. If the holding costs on a $100 stock over some period are $4, the forward price must be $104. If the stock also pays a $1 dividend, the forward price must be $103. In both cases the credits and debits will exactly cancel out. The calculation of a forward price depends on the characteristics of the contract as well as market conditions. In the case of a stock, the considerations are the price of the 3. Thetrader can also earn interest on the dividend from the time he receives it until the end of the holding period. Since this will usually be a very small amount in relation to the other factors, we will ignore it.
