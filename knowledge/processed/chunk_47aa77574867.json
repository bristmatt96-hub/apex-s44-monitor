Fielders have to make in - the- moment game decisions about where to throw the ball: hit the cutoff man, throw behind a base runner, throw out an advancing base run- ner. Where the outfielder throws after fielding the ball is a bet. We make similar bets about where to \u201cthrow\u201d an outcome: into the \u201cskill bucket\u201d (in our control) or the \u201cluck bucket\u201d (out - side of our control). This initial fielding of outcomes, if done well, allows us to focus on experiences that have something to teach us (skill) and ignore those that don\u2019t (luck). Get this right and, with experience, we get closer to whatever \u201c-ER\u201d we are striving for: better, smarter, healthier, happier, wealthier, etc. It is hard to get this right.

Just as they relied on reconnaissance, we shouldn\u2019t plan our future without doing advance work on the range of futures that could result from any given decision and the probabilities of those futures occurring. For us to make better decisions, we need to perform recon- naissance on the future. If a decision is a bet on a particular fu- ture based on our beliefs, then before we place a bet we should consider in detail what those possible futures might look like. Any decision can result in a set of possible outcomes. Thinking about what futures are contained in that set (which we do by putting memories together in a novel way to imagine how things might turn out) helps us figure out which decisions to make. Figure out the possibilities, then take a stab at the probabil- ities. T o start, we imagine the range of potential futures. This is also known as scenario planning. Nate Silver, who compiles and interprets data from the perspective of getting the best strategic use of it, frequently takes a scenario- planning approach.
