Spreads need not be based solely on the relationship between different delivery Months for the same commodity. They can also be based on presumed price relation- ships between different, though usually related, instruments. The NOB (notes over bonds) spread traded on the Chicago Board of Trade is based on the assumption that there is an identifiable relationship between the price of Treasury Bonds and Treasury Notes. When the spread between the prices of these two futures contracts is more or less than expected, traders will sell one instrument and buy the other. For example, with Treasury Notes at 99-162 and Treasury Bonds at 96-00, there is a 3-16 spread between the two instruments. If a trader feels, based on his analysis of interest rates, 1, Because of their unique importance in financial markets, we will look at stock index futures and options in detail in Chapter 15. 2.

If the spread returns to its expected value of 3-00, the trader can buy in his Notes and sell out his Bonds, realizing a profit of 169, Spreads can also be based on more complex relationships. Many traders on the COMEX follow the price relationship between gold and silver. However, with gold at $300 to $400 per ounce and silver at $4 to $5 per ounce (as of this writing), the relationship is more commonly expressed as a ratio. Suppose a trader decides that the spread between the two metals ought to be 80 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold (an 80:1 ratio). If silver is trading at $4.50, given the 80:1 price ratio, gold ought to be trading at $4.50 x 80 = $360. If, however, gold is at $375, the spread trader will sell one ounce of gold at $375, and buy 80 ounces of silver at $4.50. Regardless of the general trend in prices of precious metals, he expects to make $15 when the spread returns to its 80:1 ratio. If the precious metals market drops, so that gold is at $336 and silver is at $4.20 (the expected 80:1 ratio), the trader\u2019s total profit will be: 80 x ($4.20 - $4.50) = -$24 (silver) $375 \u2014 $336 = +$39 (gold) As expected, he has shown a profit of $15. Spreads can also reflect a trader\u2019s opinion that one contract will outperform a different contract. Futures on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index traded on the New York Futures Exchange represent the value of approximately 1500 actively traded stocks. Futures on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange represent the value of 500 such stocks. If a trader believes the relationship between the two index values ought to be 9 to 5 (9 NYSE = 4 S&P 500), and the current prices are 220 and 396, the price relationship is, as expected, 9:5 (9 x 220 = 5 x 396). There does not seem to be any reason to either buy or sell the spread. If, however, a trader believes that in percent terms the 500 stocks in the S&P will outperform the 1500 stocks in the NYSE, he can buy five S&P contracts and sell nine NYSE contracts. If, in percent terms, the S&P rises more quickly, or declines less quickly, the trader will profit from the better performance",
