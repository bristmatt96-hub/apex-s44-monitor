After all, how many professional option traders are there? To everyone\u2019s (pleasant) surprise, when the book came out not only did it turn out that a large number of professionals were purchasing the book, but many non-professionals also seemed to be very interested in this approach. The revised edition is no different in its focus. The new material is likely to be of greatest interest to the serious option trader. While the material may also be of interest to the non-professional, it is the professional, whose livelihood depends on a complete understanding of options, who will be most willing to spend the time required to master the material. In the new edition I have tried to incorporate the comments and suggestions which traders have made concerning the first edition. Some of the more important additions: Expanded coverage of stock options\u2014When J sat down to write the first edition the emphasis was on commodity options. This was primarily a marketing decision. At the time there were several books available on stock options, but hardly any commodity options. However, with the success of the first edition, and at the suggestion of many friends at the CBOE, I felt it would be worthwhile giving stock options equal emphasis. More on volatility\u2014Given its importance, a second chapter on volatility has been added with more detailed discussion of volatility characteristics and considerations. A chapter on stock index futures and options\u2014These markets have become so important, and are so interconnected, that some discussion is mandatory in any book on options. While one chapter cannot possibly cover every aspect of index markets, I have tried to touch on how these markets differ from traditional option markets, and the effect of these differences on trading strategies. ___ A discussion of intermarket spreading\u2014Much of the most sophisticated trading involves spreading options in one underlying market against options in a different Underlying market. I have included a discussion on the relationship between similar underlying markets, and the methods traders use to construct spreads when a relation- ship appears to be mispriced. A more detailed discussion of volatility skews\u2014This is probably the one area about Which I am most often asked, the tendency of different exercise prices to trade at different implied volatilities. I have tried to include a discussion of this phenomenon, and several methods by which traders deal with this problem. xili xiv Preface I have also deleted two appendicies: A guide to software\u2014New software is being introduced so quickly that it did not seem practical to include a list of vendors and products as I did in the first edition. Nor am I familiar with every piece of software available, so it would be unfair to those vendors who have good products but whom I might inadvertantly omit. The best way for traders to choose software is to talk to other traders and to read some of the industry periodicals to find out what programs are being used to evaluate options. Historical volatilities When the first edition came out I suspected that some new traders might not have access to any volatility data, so I included some historical volatility graphs for selected futures contracts. Now, however, volatility data in some form is available to almost all option traders so I did not feel that volatility charts, which would quickly become outdated, would be worth including. As in the first edition, I make no claims to being a theoretician, and this book is not intended to take the place of a good book on option theory. But theory is only important as a Means to an end\u2014the actual trading of options in the marketplace. Whatever theory is in the book, | have tried to present in non-technical language. For a more complete discussion of option pricing theory, the reader can consult any of the advanced books to be found in Appendix F, Nor is it my intention to make decisions for the reader or to tell the reader how to trade. There are many ways to trade successfully in an option market. Regardless of a trader\u2019s own style, without a complete familiarity with the necessary tools, and a proficiency in their use, it is almost impossible to be successful in options. I have tried to explain what these tools are, how they work, and the variety of ways in which traders use them to make decisions that fit their own individual needs and trading styles. In doing so, [ have attempted, as much as possible, to avoid contaminating the reader with my own personal preferences and prejudices. Tn a sense, nothing in either this or the first edition of Option Volatility and Pricing Strategies is new. All the theory, trading strategies, and risk management considera- tions, are familiar to experienced traders in one form or another. My goal has been to put all this material together and present it in an orderly, easily understandable format which I hope will form a solid foundation upon which an aspiring option trader can build a successful career. This book is a result not only of my efforts, but of the efforts of the many traders who were kind enough to read this material and offer their comments and suggestions. Without their help I could not hope to cover all the important aspects of options. To all of them, and to the editors at Probus Publishing Company, who displayed patience above and beyond the call of duty, I offer my thanks and enduring gratitude.
