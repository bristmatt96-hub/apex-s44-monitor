John was excited to have our company and to share his passion for his nature preserve with us. He was so proud of how he had invested his earnings in caring for these 5000 acres. Double-backing the way we came had worked. We were rewarded when John took us to the main house, which at the time was still in the final stages of construction. There were several identical enormous circular granite floors, each with wraparound decks. There were no walls or windows separating the interior from the rainforest. It was a once-in-a-lifetime 69 experience to look out from the top of the structure. It was at the highest point of the jungle, and you could see all the way to the ocean. After dinner, Ann helped me upload my photos on her computer. Having recently purchased a Fujifilm 3.2 megapixel camera, I was very proud of it. As John spoke during dinner, he mostly talked about quantum physics, and specifically about the topic of entanglement. Towards the end of the day, the sun was setting over the ridge. We all sat down on a planted overlook where John had a small farm setup. The clearing provided the perfect view of what seemed like a hand-selected sunset for the occasion. It was during this conversation that John became most passionate about trading\u2014well, specifically about one trader. As a matter of fact, John was enraged by this trader, and he had reported him several times to the authorities with no result. The serenity of hundreds of miles around him did not lessen his distress. Having a beer with the guys and hearing them talk about the world of trading, which I had no understanding of at the time, made me feel privileged. Nearly seven years later, I would hear that trader\u2019s name again, and I will never forget it, because it was all over the news. It was announced that Bernie Madoff had been arrested. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I vividly recalled the time I had been just a kid watching a sunset, excited to drink an Imperial Beer, and listening to John recount how he was doing everything in his power to expose Madoff \u2019s fraud. In a tragic circumstance, John died two years after Madoff \u2019s arrest, in that same beautiful home, disturbingly from a single gunshot wound to the head. The circumstances remain shrouded in mystery. I can only say that John and Ann were the best hosts we could have ever asked for. In the same way that Market Wizards changed the world for so many readers, John and Ann had changed my life for the better in ways that I will never be able to thank them for. My last writing for my dad\u2019s books was the epilogue to Hedge Fund Market Wizards. There\u2019s no other way to end the introduction to this chapter than what I said there: 70 A couple of months ago, I was out for happy hour with a few associates. One of them asked me, \u201cDo you feel that because of your dad you have a lot to live up to as a trader?\u201d to which I replied, \u201cIt would be far easier to be as successful as my dad in trading than to be as successful as he is on a human level. My dad is one of the kindest, humblest, and most generous people I have ever come across. I would much rather be as great a person as he is than be as successful as he is.\u201d *** Do you remember coming to America? I was four years old at the time. I don\u2019t recall the voyage, but I remember that after we arrived in America, our entire family lived in a single room for about half a year (a residence provided by the HIAS, a refugee aid organization). Do you have any memories of what that experience was like? I remember how happy I was to leave. My father got a job as a busboy and was able to rent an apartment in East New York, which is in Brooklyn. It was a small tenement apartment, but it seemed terrific compared to where we had been living. Did you ever talk to your parents about how they survived the Holocaust? Yes, but one of my greatest regrets is that I didn\u2019t have more extensive conversations with them about their years in Europe during World War II. Here\u2019s what I know. My mother lived in Belgium in the early war years. She was in the hospital giving birth to my half-brother when the Germans did their sweeps rounding up Jews. Her husband was arrested and later killed. So, she and my brother would not have survived if she had not given birth then. My mother had a close friend whose boyfriend worked for the Belgian police. My mother obtained false papers through that connection. She got by for a while with false documents, but that was only a short-term solution. Eventually, she fled to Switzerland. I wish I could tell you how she managed 71 that feat with an infant, but I just don\u2019t know. When she crossed the Swiss border, she was arrested and placed in a refugee camp, where she remained until the end of the war. As for my father, he escaped from a labor camp with his brother. I wish I remembered how they escaped, but I guess I was told the story when I was young and don\u2019t recall more detail. I also know that my father, who was German, was living in Germany near the end of the war, passing as a gentile. Two weeks before the end of the war, he was walking his German Shepard and was stopped by two Gestapo officers. They initially argued with each other, one insisting that my father was not Jewish and should",
