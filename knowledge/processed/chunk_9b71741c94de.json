With that kind of haircut, you have to ask yourself just how good you think you are. Can you hedge, beat the hedge hurdle, and still make enough to make the venture worth your time? Not likely. When most traders talk about tail risk, they refer to the kind of events that can put a trader out of business, but remember that tail events are not always bad. Sometimes the trader may be positioned on the right side of the surprise move, and it turns out to be a gift. Though some traders have tried, it is very dif\ufb01cult to structure strategies designed speci\ufb01cally to take advantage of these events, because they are so infrequent and volatile. Even if you are fortunate enough to be on the right side of such a move, there is no guarantee that you will \ufb01nd adequate liquidity to exit at a pro\ufb01t. Correlation Correlation is a major concern in portfolio design and analysis, but also may have a larger than expected impact on an active trader holding a handful of positions.

Figure 9.5 shows the effect of several margin hikes for Silver futures on the trend in mid-2011. Intuitively, you might expect that such a margin increase would be insigni\ufb01cant, but it can force liquidation and bring large-scale selling pressure into the market. The Hunt brothers\u2019 silver \ufb01asco in the early 1980s is one of the best-known examples, but there have been many others as the regulatory environment continually evolves in response to the actions of traders and investors. In equities, there are frequent restrictions on shorting that may cause actual trad- ing results to diverge from theoretical tests, and there have even been examples where shorting has been banned altogether for a group of stocks or entire regions. In early 2011, some of the cutting edges of regulatory coverage are the issues surrounding HFTs, algo- rithmic trading programs, and the prevalence of computer-assisted trading programs that seek to capture the liquidity rebates across electronic communication networks (ECNs). It is quite likely that some regulatory move in the next few years will signi\ufb01cantly alter the market microstructure and force traders to adapt. It has also been fairly common to see trades broken in some environments.

Keep in mind that these examples re\ufb02ect my trading style, which is a pure swing trader\u2019s approach that can be summarized as follows: r Understanding bigger picture money \ufb02ows between markets. In stocks this might mean understanding the difference in performance between domestic and foreign indexes, and then understanding which sectors offer the most attractive opportuni- ties. This concept can be adapted to other asset classes as well, but the key is to start from a high-level perspective and to work top-down. r Waiting for precise patterns that indicate the presence of an imbalance. These pat- terns also give risk points (stop levels) for each position. r Executing trades to position with the statistical tendency behind that pattern. r Managing the risk in the trade appropriately, perhaps adjusting the position as the trade develops. r In almost all cases, I am playing for one clean swing in the market. The last part of that is particularly important: a swing trader\u2019s job is to take money out of one swing, usually the next swing, in the market. Swing traders do not enter posi-",
