This chapter explains important themes in quantitative trading in more detail. These themes form the bases of statistical arbitrage trading, and most quantitative trad- ers are conversant in some if not most of these topics. They are also very helpful in informing our intuition about trading. I will describe the two basic categories of trading strategies: mean-reverting versus momentum strategies. Periods of mean- reverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders call regimes, and the different regimes require different strategies, or at least different parameters of the same strategy. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathematical justification from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration of time series, which I will cover next. Following that, I will discuss a novel application of machine learning to adapt the parameters of a trading strategy to different regimes that we call Conditional Parameter Optimization (CPO). Then I will describe a theory that many hedge funds use to manage large portfolios and one that has caused much turmoil in their per- formances: namely, factor models. Other categories of strategies that traders frequently discuss are seasonal trading and high-frequency Special Topics in Quantitative Trading Chan800064_c07.indd 133 6/7/2021 7:16:52 AM 64 This PDF file is part of the audiobook QUANTITATIVE TRADING and cannot be sold separately.

How could you know how big an order an institution needs to execute incrementally? How do you predict when the \u201cherd\u201d is large enough to form a stampede? Where is the infamous tipping point? If we do not have a reliable way to esti- mate these time horizons, we cannot execute a momentum trade profitably based on these phenomena. In a later section on regime switch, I will examine some attempts to predict these tipping or \u201cturning\u201d points. There are other causes of momentum that are more predictable: the persistence of roll returns in futures markets, and forced sale and purchases of securities due to risk",
