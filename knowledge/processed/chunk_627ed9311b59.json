We want to begin to develop better awareness of our thoughts and feelings, and especially how they show up and change. Three times a day, simply note your mood, sensations, any prevalent thoughts, anything specifi c that might have stimulated your feelings and your thoughts, and whether you chose to have these thoughts or if they just showed up on their own. Time What I Was Feeling/ Mood Body Sensations I Noticed What My Mind Was Telling Me Situation/ Event Did I Choose to Have These Thou ghts and Feelings or Did They Just Show Up? Sample: 8:00 A.M. Upbeat and excited. I was also feeling confi dent. Warmth; tingling in arms and hands \u201cToday is going to be a good day. I can\u2019t wait to trade\u201d Pre\u2010open reviewing my game plan for the day. Even though these were positive, the y showed up on their own. In truth, I didn\u2019t choose them. 3:00 P.M . Tired and bored. Shoulders tense. Body felt heavy. \u201cMarkets are dull.\u201d I noticed my mind encouraged me to surf the \u2019net and call friends. Narrow trading range. Nothing happening in the markets. Arose on own. I believe they were stimulated by the dullness of the market. I certainly didn\u2019t want to feel bored. 7:30 P.M . Feeling positive an d energized. Body felt light. Ready to get going. \u201cA breakout tomorrow will lead to a big move. I can make good money tomorrow.\u201d Reviewing markets and making game plan for tomorrow. Again, they show up on their own. Funny how I\u2019m not really in control of what I think or feel! 29 This PDF file is part of the audiobook TRADE MINDFULLY and cannot be sold separately.
