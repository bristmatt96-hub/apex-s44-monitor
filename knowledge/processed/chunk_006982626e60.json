  "content": "your actual trading. When applyin g mindfulness to these various, less demandin g tradin g activities, be sure to also notice what mindfulness does for you. See if distractin g thou g hts and feel - ings recede into the background. See if you are more attentive and aware of the tas k you are performin g . See if you start seein g thin g s you mi g ht normally miss. See if you are en g a g in g your deliberative mind, rather than jumpin g to quick and easy conclu - sions. Keep in mind, too, that being mindful when performing these activities will build mindfulness skills for more challen g in g situations later. Remember, mindfulness is a mental skill and, like an y skill, the more we practice it, the more profi cient and e ff ective we become in using it. Y ou will also likely fi nd that you will be more e ffi cien t and more observant as you mindfully perform these important tradin g tasks. \u25a0Notes 1. Susan M.
