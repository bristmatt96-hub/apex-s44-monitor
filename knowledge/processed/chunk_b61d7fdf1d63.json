Suppose a trader estimates that over the life of an option the volatility of an underlying Deutschemark futures contract will be 13%. Based on this estimate he finds that a certain call trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a theoretical value of 1.75 but is actually trading for 2.00. If the call has a delta of 25, one strategy is to sell four calls for 2.00 each and buy one futures contract, yielding a theoretical edge of 4 x .25 = 1.00, or $1,250. (Each point in currency contracts at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is worth $1,250.) Of course, if the trader can make $1,250 with a 4x 1 spread, it may occur to him that he can make $12,500 if he increases the size of the spread to 40 x 10. Why stop now? He can make $125,000 if he increases the size to 400 x 100. Even if the market is sufficiently liquid to absorb unlimited size, is this a reasonable approach to trading? Should a trader simply find a theoretically profitable strategy and do it as many times as possible in order to maximize the profit potential? At some point the intelligent trader will have to consider not only the potential profit, but also the risk associated with a strategy. After all, his volatility estimate of 13% is just that, an estimate. What will happen if volatility actually turns out to be some higher number, perhaps 15%, or 17%? If the calls which he sold at 2.00 are worth 2.25 at a volatility of 17%, and volatility actually turns out to be 17%, then his hoped-for profit of $125,000 (assuming a size of 400 x 100) will turn into a loss of $125,000. A trader must always consider the effects of an incorrect estimate, and then decide how much risk he is willing to take. If the trader in this example decides that he can survive if volatility goes no higher than 15% (a two-percentage-point margin for error), he might only be willing to do the spread 40 x 10. But if there were some way to increase his break-even volatility to 19% (a six-percentage-point margin for error), he Might indeed be willing to do the spread 400 x 100. Option spreading strategies enable traders to profit over a wide variety of market conditions by giving them an increased margin for error in estimating the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. No trader will survive very long if his livelihood depends on estimating each input with 100% accuracy. Even when he incorrectly estimates the inputs, the experienced trader can survive if he has constructed intelligent spread strategies which allow for a wide margin of error. SPREADING AS A RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL Recall our example in Chapter 3 where a casino is selling a roulette bet with an expected return of 95\u00a2 (American conditions) for $1.00. The casino owner knows that based on 134 Chapter 7 the laws of probability he has a 5% theoretical edge. Suppose that one day a bettor comes into the casino and proposes to bet $2,000 on one number at the roulette table. The casino owner knows that the odds are on his side and that he will most likely get to keep the $2,000 bet. But there is always a chance that the player will win, and that the casino will lose $70,000 (the $72,000 payoff less the $2,000 cost of the bet) if the player\u2019s number does come up. Now suppose that two other bettors come into the casino, and each proposes to place a $1,000 bet at the roulette table. They promise, however, to bet on different numbers. Whichever number one bettor chooses, the other bettor will choose some other number. As with the first bettor and his single bet of $2,000, the casino\u2019s potential reward in this new scenario is also $2,000, if neither of the two numbers come up. But the risk to the casino is now only $34,000 (the $36,000 payoff if one player wins, less the cost of the two $1,000 bets). Since only one player can win, the two bets are mutually exclusive: if one wins, the other must lose. Given our two scenarios, one bettor wagering $2,000 on one number, or two players wagering $1,000 each on different numbers, what is the theoretical edge to the casino? The edge to the casino in both cases is still the same 5%. Regardless of the amount wagered, or the number of individual bets, the laws of probability say that in the long run the casino gets to keep 5% of everything that is bet at the roulette table. In the short run, however, the risk to the casino is greatly reduced with two $1,000 bets because the bets have been spread around the table. A casino does not like to see a bettor wager a large amount of money on one outcome, whether at roulette or any other casino game. The odds are still in the casino\u2019s favor. But, if the bet is large enough, and the bettor is lucky, short-term bad luck can overwhelm the casino. Indeed, if a bettor knows that the odds are against him, and he wants the greatest chance of showing a profit, his best course is to wager the maximum amount on one outcome, and hope that in the short run he gets lucky. If he continues to make bets over a long period of time, the laws of probability will eventually catch up with him and the casino will end up with the bettor\u2019s money. The ideal scenario from the casino\u2019s point of view is for 38 players to place 38 bets of $1,000 each on all 38 numbers at the roulette table. Now the casino",
