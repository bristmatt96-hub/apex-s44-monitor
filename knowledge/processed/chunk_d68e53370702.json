For options on futures contracts, however, the expiration need not coincide with the delivery month specified in the option contract. In some cases the exact expiration date for a futures option can predate the delivery month of the underlying futures contract by several weeks. A crude oil option on the NYMEX will typically expire the first Saturday of the preceding month, so that an October option will actually expire the first Saturday in September. 1. Several exchanges have recently introduced flex options, which permit the buyer and seller to negotiate both the exercise price and expiration date. These are still considered exchange traded options since the contracts are guaranteed by the exchange.

A trader who exercises a crude oil October 21 call has chosen to take a long position in one October crude oil futures contract at $21 per barrel. A trader who exercises a GE March 80 put has chosen to take a short position in 100 shares of GE stock at $80 per share. Once an option is exercised it ceases to exist, just as if it had been allowed to expire unexercised. A trader who intends to exercise an option must submit an exercise notice to either the seller of the option, if purchased from a dealer, or to the guarantor of the option, if purchased on an exchange. When a valid exercise notice is submitted, the seller of the option is assigned. Depending on the type of option, he will ne required to take a long or short position in the underlying contract at the specified exercise price.

The great majority of exchange traded options throughout the world are American options, carrying with them the right of early exercise. Indeed, all U.S. exchange traded stock and futures options are American.* As in any competitive market, an option\u2019s price, or premium, is determined by supply and demand. Buyers and sellers make competitive bids and offers in the marketplace. When a bid and offer coincide, a trade is made. The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components, the intrinsic value and the time value. An option\u2019s intrinsic value is the amount which would be credited to the option holder\u2019s account if he were to exercise the option and close out the position against the underlying contract at the current market price. For example, with gold trading at $435 per ounce, the intrinsic value of a $400 call is $35. By exercising his option, the holder of the $400 call can buy gold at $400 per ounce.
