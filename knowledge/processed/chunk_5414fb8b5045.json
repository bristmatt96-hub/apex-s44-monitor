Ill Harriman House 5 Preface to the Revised Edition I am doing something with this volume I have never done before in any Market Wizards book: revisiting the traders years later for an update. I conducted the original interviews for Unknown Market Wizards in 2019. The years since then have been remarkably eventful, witnessing a worldwide pandemic, extraordinary government stimulative actions, a transition from low inflation to the highest inflation in 40 years, and two bear markets. The assumption that readers would be curious about how the traders interviewed navigated the turbulent markets of this interim period provided the catalyst for my decision to conduct follow-up interviews for this revised edition. How have the traders fared in the intervening years since the original interviews? As demonstrated by the accompanying table, which summarizes the annual returns and worst drawdown experienced by the traders during the past four years, they have continued to generate superior performance. All but two of the traders had average annual returns greater than 20%, with some far exceeding this level. The only two traders below this average return level maintained strong return/risk performance. Their more moderate returns simply resulted from their choosing to run low-exposure portfolios. 6 They could have doubled their exposure levels\u2014and, by implication, returns\u2014and still had low maximum draw down levels. Two statistics that require further explanation are Camillo\u2019s 2022 return and the surveyed period maximum drawdown. These numbers, which seem to imply that Camillo witnessed a devasting surrender of previous profits, are misleading. These figures miss that, in 2022, Camillo recognized the market environment was unfavorable to his strategy and drastically reduced his trading size (an action discussed in the update to his chapter), thereby greatly mitigating his dollar losses. As a result, despite the huge percentage decline in 2022, he only surrendered about 13% of the profits of the prior three years, and the period since our original interview represented the best performance of his career. There is a valuable lesson here: reducing your exposure when your trading is out of sync with the markets is critical to long-term success. Readers may note that Jeffrey Neumann is missing from the accompanying table. This omitted entry reflects Neumann\u2019s reluctance to have his performance numbers made public, which, in some sense, is ironic since the last few years were the best of his entire career (a fact I was able to verify) and arguably the best of any trader surveyed in this volume. 7 Annual Return (%)* Average Annual Compounded Return Average Annual Arithmetic Return Maximum Drawdown (%)** 2019 2020 2021 2022 2019\u20132022 2019\u20132022 2019\u20132022 Brandt 37.1 39.4 50.2 52.9 44.7 44.9 \u22127.0 Shapiro 9.9 18.4 17.3 15.1 15.1 15.2 \u22123.6 Bargh 166.2 80.0 52.4 119.0 100.0 104.4 \u22129.7 Sall 121.4 48.6 101.7 273.5 123.1 136.3 \u221231.0 Dhaliwal 466.0 80.0 50.4 17.2 105.9 153.4 \u221216.2 Netto 4.4 5.6 53.4 26.9 21.0 22.6 \u221210.5 Camillo 28.2 356.5 8.4 \u221252.9 31.5 85.1 \u221267.1 Parker 15.6 53.7 19.8 \u22120.4 20.7 22.2 \u221218.9 Kean 34.1 54.6 23.8 \u22126.8 24.4 26.4 \u221216.4 Krej\u010d\u00ed 15.0 14.5 9.6 6.9 11.4 11.5 \u22127.0 * All returns are gross (i.e., returns exclude management and incentive fee deductions in cases where return figures are based on managed accounts).
