A 100/105 call vertical spread will trade for some amount between zero and five points; a 95/105 put vertical spread will trade for some amount between zero and 10 points. The exact value will depend on the likelihood of the underlying market finishing below the lower exercise price, above the higher exercise price, or somewhere in between. If the market is currently at 80 and gives little indication of rising, the price of the 100/105 call vertical will be close to zero, while the price of the 95/105 puts vertical will be close to 10. If the market is currently at 120 with little likelihood that it will fall, the price of the 100/105 call vertical will be close to five points, while the price of the 95/105 put vertical will be close to zero. If a trader wants to do a vertical spread, he has essentially four choices. If he is bullish he can choose a bull vertical call spread or a bull vertical put spread; if he is bearish he can choose a bear vertical call spread or a bear vertical put spread. For example: bull call spread: buy aJune 100 call sell a June 105 call bull put spread: buy a June 100 put sell a June 105 put bear call spread: sell a June 100 call buy a June 105 call bear put spread: sell a June 100 put buy a June 105 put Note that a trader who is bullish can buy a 100 call and sell a 105 call, or buy a 100 put and sell a 105 put. And a trader who is bearish can buy a 105 call and sell a 100 call, or buy a 105 put and sell 100 put. This may seem counter-intuitive, since one expects spreads which consist of puts to have characteristics which are the opposite of those which consist of calls. Regardless of whether a vertical spread consists of calls or puts, whenever a trader buys the lower exercise price and sells the higher exercise price, the position is bullish; whenever a trader buys the higher exercise price and sells the lower exercise price, the position is bearish. Call and put vertical spreads which expire at the same time and which consist of the same exercise prices have approxi- mately the same delta, so they have approximately the same bullish or bearish charac- teristics.2 Given the many different exercise prices and expiration months available, how can a trader choose the vertical spread which best reflects his directional expectations and which gives him the best chance to profit from those expectations? Since options have a limited life with a fixed expiration date, a trader who wants to use options to take advantage of an expected market move must first determine his time horizon. Is the movement likely to occur in the next month, in the next three months, in the next nine months? If it is currently May and the trader foresees upward 2. Weare assuming for the moment that all options are European, with no possibility of early exercise. Bull and Bear Spreads 205 movement, but believes the movement is unlikely to occur within the next two months, it does not make much sense to take a position in June options. If his expectations are long-term, he may have to take his position in September, or even December, options. Of course, as he moves further and further out in time, market liquidity may become more of a problem. This is a factor that will have to taken into consideration. Next, a trader will have to decide just how bullish or bearish he is. Is he very confident, and therefore willing to take a very large directional position? Or is he less certain and willing to take only a limited position? Two factors determine the total directional characteristics of a vertical spread: 1. The delta of the specific vertical spread 2. The size in which the spread is executed For example, a trader who wants to take a position which is 500 deltas long (equivalent to purchasing five underlying contracts) can either choose a vertical spread which is 50 deltas long and execute it 10 times, or choose a vertical spread which is 25 deltas long and execute it 20 times. Both positions will leave him long 500 deltas. The delta value of a vertical spread is determined by various factors: time to expiration, volatility, and distance between exercise prices. Since a trader will be required to choose an expiration date which covers the period of expected directional movement, and since a trader will always make his best estimate of volatility over a given period, in practice the delta will be a function of the exercise prices which he chooses. The greater the distance between exercise prices, the greater the delta value associated with the spread. A 95/110 bull spread will be more bullish than a 100/110 bull spread, which will, in turn, be more bullish than a 100/105 bull spread. This is shown in Figure 10-3. Once a trader decides on an expiration month in which to take his directional position, he must decide which specific spread is best. That is, he must decide which exercise prices to use. A common approach is to focus on the at-the-money options. If a trader does this, he will have the following choices: Bull call spread: buy anin-themoneycall or buy an at-themoney call sell an at-the-money call sell an out-of-the-money Bear call spread: buyanatthemoneycall or buy an out-of-the-money call sell an in-the-money call sell an at-the-money call Bull put spread: buyanat-the-moneyput or buy an out-of-the-money put sell an in-the-money put sell an at-the-money put Bear put spread: buy anin-the-money put or buy an at-the-money put",
