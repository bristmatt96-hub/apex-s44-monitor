A few things jump out here. First of all, these numbers do seem to be roughly com- parable at \ufb01rst glance. We see that both the mean and the median values have increased, which is to be expected because, as the account grows\u2014which, on average, it does with this positive expectancy system\u2014\ufb01xed fractional sizing allows you to take on more risk. This is essentially a way to leverage your winners and to use accumulated trading pro\ufb01ts to fund further risk. We note that the standard deviation has increased fairly dramatically; the coef\ufb01cient of variation does not look good. In fact, if they were directly comparable, Table 9.2 suggests we should be able to hit a mean terminal value of around $200,000 for a coef\ufb01cient of variation of 0.35 with a \ufb01xed dollar amount risk plan. Perhaps we are a little disappointed with the \ufb01xed fractional results, which seem to have increased volatility of returns without compensating for the extra risk. In fact, the \ufb01xed fractional approach would have a lower Sharpe ratio for a commensurate return. Naive rules would suggest that this is lower risk-adjusted return, but hold off on making any decisions for a moment. There just may be more to this story. Digging a little deeper, we see that the mean of maximum value has increased fairly signi\ufb01cantly, without any real change in the mean of minimum value. In fact, both the mean of minimum value and the lowest terminal value from the run have increased, and we also see that the highest terminal value is about 1.7 times what it was with the \ufb01xed sizing. Figure 9.2 gives some insight into what is going on.

However, the average closing value is well over $5,000,000, and one of the accounts made almost two billion dollars. This is not a bad run from a starting value of $100,000. The 8.333 percent example in Table 9.5 is a special case: it is the Kelly number for this particular system. It is worth pointing out that this is exactly the kind of situation in which the Kelly criterion can be safely applied. The wins and losses are all the same size, and there are never any surprises in the form of larger-than-expected wins or losses. In addition, each trade is completely independent of preceding trades. In other words, there are never longer strings of winners and losers than you would expect to see in random data. The Kelly number produces some pretty impressive results, with mean and median terminal values far exceeding anything we were able to hit with the (reasonable) con- stant risk scenarios. In addition, the Kelly criterion opens the door to truly outstanding performance; one of our Kelly-sized accounts would have run the $100,000 initial invest- ment up to over $20 million by the end of the run. As you might expect from an aggressive strategy, there is also signi\ufb01cant risk of loss, as 4.6 percent of the accounts closed under $25,000. Even so, there may be situations in which a trader could accept the risks of an optimized strategy in return for the potential reward. This might depend on the trader\u2019s risk tolerance and investment goals for the account. For instance, is the trading account your entire net worth, or is it just a small subaccount that you intend to press aggres- sively? These questions go beyond the math behind the strategies, but they are important questions to consider before you actually put capital at risk in the market. As you might imagine, since it is an optimized, aggressive number, bad things start to happen when we risk more than the Kelly criterion suggests.
