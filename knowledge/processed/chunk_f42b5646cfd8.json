The science of option evaluation is an important part of any trader\u2019s education, but mathematical models are only a tool to help the trader make decisions. Successful option trading is at least as much an art as a science, and a trader must know where science leaves off, and other intangible assets, whether intuition or market feel or experience, begin. This brings us to one final point, and perhaps the most important principle of option trading: there is no substitute for common sense. A trader who slavishly uses a model to make every trading decision is heading for disaster. Only a trader who fully understands what a model can and cannot do will be able to make the model his servant rather than his master. ** Appendix A + A Glossary of Option and Related Terminology Alt or None (AON)\u2014An order which must be filled in its entirety or not at all.
