In practice, often taken as a sign of impending price weakness. drawdown In trading system design or application, the amount lost from the high-water mark for the system/account. This is an underutilized measure of risk. economically signi\ufb01cant Statistical signi\ufb01cance is a reasonably well-understood subject, but there can be patterns that are statistically signi\ufb01cant without being economically signi\ufb01cant. For instance, perhaps a pattern shows a very consistent edge, but it would be impossible to capture that edge because it is smaller than transaction costs. It is often dif\ufb01cult to truly evaluate economic signi\ufb01cance because costs will vary from \ufb01rm to \ufb01rm and from trader to trader\u2014what might not be economically signi\ufb01cant to one trader could be a steady income for another. Ef\ufb01ciency Ratio (ER) A measure developed by Perry Kaufman also known as the Fractal Ef\ufb01ciency Ratio, the Ef\ufb01ciency Ratio varies from 0 to 1 and is a measure of price move- ment compared to noise in the market. If price moves in an unbroken line for the period, the ER would be 1. If price returns to unchanged after moving away from the starting price, the ER would be 0. ef\ufb01cient markets hypothesis (EMH) Perhaps the cornerstone of academic thinking about markets, the EMH essentially says that all available information is immediately incorpo- rated into asset prices, and that there is no edge available to traders doing analysis based on that information. The EMH is a useful theoretical construct, but rests on a number of assumptions that are severely violated in practice. excess return In general, the return of an asset or system minus the risk-free rate. (The most common proxy for risk-free rate is a Treasury instrument of similar duration to the investment\u2019s holding period.) In many of the tests in this book, excess return is used in a slightly different context: the mean return of a signal group (de\ufb01ned as having the entry condition to be studied) over the baseline return for the control group. execution risk A risk of trading in which the actual prices received for executions may differ from backtested results. In practice, liquidity conditions, execution skill, and trad- ing size are primary contributors to this risk. exhaustion See climax. expectancy or expected value Mathematically, the expected payout of a scenario that has several possible outcomes is the sum of the probability of each outcome occurring times their payoffs. exponential moving average (EMA) A type of moving average that weights recent data more heavily than past data. extension In trend analysis, the third leg of the impulse-retracement-impulse unit that comprises the basic trend structure. Gauging the strength of the extension leg is one of the main ways to judge strength of the trend. fading A general term for styles of trading that seek to trade against the direction of price movements. A trader fading an uptrend, for instance, would be shorting into that uptrend. 180 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

This term, and holding, are more often used to describe dy- namic price action than static market structure. See holding. failure test A type of trade in which price penetrates previous support or resistance, and then fails to continue beyond that level. This is a potentially volatile trade, but it also offers very clear risk points and pro\ufb01t targets. fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) A mathematical technique for \ufb01nding cycles in data. Fibonacci ratios The idea that ratios derived from the so-called Fibonacci series {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... } describe price movements in \ufb01nancial markets. \ufb01rst-order pivots A pivot high is a bar that is preceded and followed by lower highs; a pivot low has higher lows before and after. These pivot points are called \ufb01rst-order pivots to differentiate them from more signi\ufb01cant pivots in the market structure. \ufb01xed fractional risk A position-sizing plan that seeks to always risk a consistent fraction of the account\u2019s value (also called \u201cequity\u201d or \u201cnet liq\u201d) on each trade. \ufb02ag Another term for a pullback or consolidation in a trend. \ufb02ow A term coined by Mihaly Cs \u00b4\u0131kszentmih \u00b4alyi to describe the state reached by elite performers in many disciplines in which the performer\u2019s mental capacity is completely absorbed in the task. Flow is a characteristic of top-level performance. free bars Bars that are entirely outside bands or channels set on price charts\u2014that is, with the low of the bar above the upper band or the high below the lower band. fundamental Traditionally, technical analysis is the discipline of understanding market movements based on information contained in the price changes themselves. Funda- mental analysis is the discipline of using \ufb01nancial statements, economic data, or other information to try to determine what the fair value for an asset should be. futile traders A term coined by Larry Harris to describe traders who do not make money in markets, and who have no hope of doing so. Harris speculates that one reason they cannot understand the difference between their expectations and their results could be that they are \u201cof limited mental capacity.\u201d",
