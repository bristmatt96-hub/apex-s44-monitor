Figure 7.27 is an important example that shows what might have been seen as a good setup for a breakout on the daily chart: the consolidation up against re- sistance normally suggests the possibility of a strong break above that level, and is the opposite of the price rejection that normally accompanies a level holding. However, the weekly chart provided context, showing that the breakout was actually coming near the top of what was more likely to be bearish complex consolidation on the weekly chart. In this case, the higher time frame provides a bearish bias, which clearly contradicts the smaller pattern on the daily chart. The consolidation on the weekly could certainly fail, and it would do so through the success of the bullish breakout on the daily, but the probabilities favor downside continuation. There are a number of things you can do with this information, ranging from skipping the trade on the daily to taking it on smaller risk (which is not usually a good idea), or perhaps even watching for a breakout failure and entering a short trade on the daily. This last possibility combines a small pattern on one time frame with a bigger-picture bias from a higher time frame, which is an excellent use of multiple time frame information. At the very least, beware of patterns on one time frame that are clearly contradicted by strong patterns on higher time frames, especially when the patterns occur at potential in\ufb02ection points.

One common area of a more predictable spurt occurs when a pattern has broken into a move to a target\u2014for instance, on the drive out of a consolidation pattern or following a strong break of support or resistance. These situations are not that common, but recognizing that a scenario like this is in play can lend support to otherwise uninteresting lower time frame patterns. Consider Figure 7.28, which shows several small consolidations on the daily chart of Finisar Corporation (NASDAQ: FNSR). These are perfectly acceptable consolidations (the \ufb01rst is an Anti, and the second is a simple bear \ufb02ag), but the weekly chart provided strong tailwinds for these patterns and made them much more attractive than they might have been on their own. Another possible use of this concept is to monitor evolving price action on lower time frames while a trade is underway on the trading time frame. If consolidation pat- terns resolve in the intended direction of the trade, all is well. If the trade should fail, it will usually do so through a failure of one of these lower time frame patterns. Being able to read evolving price action and market structure on the lower time frame can of- ten provide excellent exits from trades, but it is necessary to balance this new layer of information against the possibility of being overly reactive to insigni\ufb01cant noise.

We know that price tends to respect support and resistance levels in trading ranges, oscillating back and forth between those levels. These levels are often rough and poorly delineated, and price action within the range tends to be more random and subject to sudden, large shocks. The irony is that what ap- pear to be large shocks on one time frame are often strong, tradable trends on the lower time frame. Since one of the cleanest trades in a range is the test beyond the con\ufb01nes of the range that immediately reverses, as in the classic Wyckoff spring or upthrust, we can trade reactions off those higher time frame ranges with some degree of con\ufb01dence. Figure 7.29 shows a continuous chart of Gold futures. After an extended uptrend, this market ran into resistance, made multiple marginal highs, and eventually rolled over into a trading range at the beginning of 2011. The sell-off found support at a previous swing low (visible on the weekly chart in the right pane), and the subsequent move off that low was a strong uptrend on the daily chart. In this case, resistance eventually failed and the market continued much higher, but this is not the point. The point is that the daily chart showed a clean, strong uptrend off the support level de\ufb01ned by the weekly FIGURE 7.29 A Clean Daily Uptrend While the Weekly Chart Is in a Trading",
