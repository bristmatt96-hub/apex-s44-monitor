Since settlement prices are usually considered the most reliable, the most common method of computing volatility involves using settlement-to-settlement price changes. We define each price change (x,) as: | fi * = Pi where P, is the price of the underlying contract at the end of the i\u00ae time interval P,/P,., is sometimes referred to as the price relative. As an example, consider the volatility of the price changes in Figure 5-1. 444 Appendix B Underlying Deviation Deviation Week Price In(P,/P,-1) Mean from Mean Squared 0 101.35 1 102.26 +.008939 007771 .000060 2 99.07 ~.031692 \u2014.032859 .001080 3 100.39 +.013236 ~ 012069 .000146 4 100.76 +.003679 nar 002512 .000006 5 103.59 +.027699 3 026532 .000704 6 99.26 ~.042698 + \u2014.043865 001924 7 98.28 ~.009922 ~.011089 = 000123 8 99.98 +.017150 015982 .000255 9 103.78 +.037303 036136 001306 10 102.54 ~.012020 ~.013188 000174 +.011674 005778 We first calulate the standard deviation of the logarithmic price changes: standard deviation = V(.005778/9) = V.000642 = .025338 We then calculate the annual volatility by multiplying the standard deviation by the square root of the time interval between price changes. Since we looked at price changes every week, the time interval is 365/7: annualized volatility = .025338 x v(365/7) = ,025338 x V52.14 = .025338 x 7.22 *, = .1829 (18.29%) We can calculate the volatility of a stock, such as in Figure 5-2, in the same way except that we must remember that the volatility is based on the forward price. This requires two modifications. Over any interval of time, in order to maintain a theoreti- cally arbitrage-free market, the stock price is expected to increase by the carrying costs on the stock over that period. If we record stock price changes at weekly intervals, the stock price is expected to rise by r/52, where ris the annualized, risk-free interest rate. The price changes are therefore expressed as: ! f 1 OT H1/5DP,_, When the stock gives up its dividend, this does not really cause a change in the stock price. We therefore include the dividend, D, in the price of the stock when calculating price change over the period when the stock goes ex-dividend: The Mathematics of Option Pricing 445 | P+D % = ip (141/52)(P,_1) Over short periods of time, or in a low-interest-rate environment, the impact of interest rates on the forward price is small, and can usually be ignored when calculating historical stock price volatility. The Extreme Value Method\u00ae When reliable settlement prices are unavailable, the extreme value method is an acceptable alternative method of calculating historical volatility. The method uses high and low prices during a period, and each data point, x,, is equal to: x, = .601 - In(H,/L,) where H, = __ the highest price over time period t L, = the lowest price over time period t The volatility is the standard deviation of all X,, annualized by multiplying by the square root of the number of time periods, t, in a year. If t is a daily interval, we must Figure B-4: Using a Newton-Raphson Search to Find the Implied Volatility theoretical value at first guess @ \u00e9 s r \u2014 theoretical value a\u201c \u00a7 at second guess 3 a _ vega at 5 first guess rd theoretical value at third guess LF oe in Price [OO eee vega at : second guess Implied Volatility Volatility \u2014- 8.

Calculation of Implied Volatility While it is not possible to invert the Black-Scholes Model to arrive at an implied volatility from a known option price, a Newton-Raphson search can be used to converge on the implied volatility quite quickly. We first make a guess as to the option\u2019s implied volatility, and then use the option\u2019s vega (sensitivity to a change in volatility) to come progressively closer to the true implied volatility. This method is illustrated in Figure B-4. Because an option\u2019s vega is relatively linear, the method converges very quickly, usually with no more than four iterations, even with a poor first guess. The iterative process",
