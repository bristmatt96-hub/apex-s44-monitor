In t h is c h a p ter, we d iscuss t h e secon d component o f t h e process, During , and the core principle of E ff ective Execu - tion wit h its associate d HVMSs an d HV As. Before we get to Eff ective Execution, however, I want to spend a little time clari - f ying t h e process o f a tra d er \u2019 s psyc h o l ogica l d eve l opment an d tra d ing per f ormance en h ancement. A l t h oug h we are d iscussing eac h o f t h e t h ree princip l es (Hig h \u2010Qua l ity Preparation, Eff ective Execution, and Constructive Self\u2010Assessment) separately , and we do want to keep them lo g ically separate to help diff erentiate them in our minds, t h ey d o h ave some over l ap. Some o f t h e HV As an d especia ll y t h e HVMSs are uti l ize d in more than one time frame. The skill of mental parkin g is a g ood example. W e dis - cusse d t h is in Hi gh \u2010Qua l ity Preparation as a s k i ll an d tec h nique t h at h e l ps us f ocus, f or instance, on our nig h t l y h omewor k , as we menta ll y par k ot h er d istractions suc h as watchin g TV or g oin g out to the pub. But the utility of mental parkin g isn\u2019t limited to t h e Before tradin g activites of preparation. Mental parkin g is an HVMS that also app l ies during tra d ing in execution. W e want to menta ll y par k , f or examp l e, a tra d ing loss in the middle of the tradin g day in order to clear our mind and be able to focus 232T RADE MINDFULLY on the next tradin g opportunity . In this way , what we learn to do well in preparation will fl ow into the other components of the process and vice versa. Aside from the overlap, what will be of g reat use to the trader is to understand how the p rinci p les of Before\u2010During\u2010After work together. W e are discussing each prin-r ciple separately in order to clarify each of them for you, but it is important to under- stand how all three principles work to g ether as a process to directly enhance your trading performance. Figure 10.1 illustrates this process. It should be obvious that the activities of Hi g h-Quality Preparation will impac t our performance durin g tradin g in Eff ective Execution. For an example, a day trader engages in High-Quality Preparation activities, including developing a game plan for the next tradin g day . She notes that the market has been trendin g hi g her. From her research, she knows that dips in the mornin g often put in the lows for the day in overall up trending conditions. She develops a game plan to buy a morning pullbac k if the volume and price action have indicated a minor reaction rather than a market chan g in g into down trendin g conditions. Can you imagine how she will trade the next day if what she anticipated in h er preparation an d game p l an un f o ld s t h e next morning?
