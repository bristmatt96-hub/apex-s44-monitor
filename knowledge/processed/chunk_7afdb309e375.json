In the past, I would have jumped in, but paying attention to all my feelings kept me out of an unplanned trade. Example 2: Developing plan for tomorrow\u2019s tradin g: identifying trade locations. Feeling very curious about obvious selling in market today. Wondering what does this mean? Feeling calm; there is no rush . Continuing to feel very interested in the evidence of selling.
