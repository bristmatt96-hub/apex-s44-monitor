Some traders feel that models are so much hocus-pocus, and have no relationship to what goes on in the real world. Other traders feel that once they have a sheet of theoretical values in hand all their problems are solved. The reality lies somewhere in between. Anew option trader is like someone entering a dark room for the first time. Without any guidance he will grope in the dark and may eventually find what he is looking for. The trader who is armed with a basic understanding of theoretical pricing models enters the same room with a small candle. He can make out the general layout of the room, but the dimness of the candle prevents him from distinguishing every detail. Moreover, some of what he does see may he distorted by the flickering candle. In spite of these limitations, a trader is more likely to find what he is looking for with a small candle than with no illumination at all. The real problems with theoretical pricing models arise after the trader has acquired Some sophistication. As he gains confidence he may begin to increase the size of his trades, When this happens, his inability to make out every detail in the room, as well as the distortions caused by the flickering candle flame, take on increased importance. Now a misinterpretation of what he thinks he sees can lead to financial disaster, since any error in judgement will be greatly magnified. The sensible approach is to make use of a model, but with a full awareness of what it can and cannot do. Option traders will find that theoretical pricing models are invaluable tools to understanding the pricing of options. Because of the insights gained from a model, the great majority of successful option traders rely on some type of 40 Chapter 3 theoretical pricing model. However, an option trader, if he is to make the best use of a theoretical pricing model, must be aware of its limitations as well as its strengths. Otherwise he may be no better off than the trader groping in the dark.2 A SIMPLE APPROACH How might we adapt the concepts of expected return and theoretical value to the pricing of options? We might begin by calculating the expected return for an option. Let\u2019s take a simple example. Suppose an underlying contract is trading at $100 and that on a certain date in the future, which we will call expiration, the contract can take on one of five different prices: $80, $90, $100, $110, or $120. Assume, moreover, that each of the five prices is equally likely with 20% probability. The prices and probabilities might be represented by the line in Figure 3-1. If we take a long position in the underlying contract at today\u2019s price of $100, what will be the expected return from this position at expiration? 20% of the time we will lose $20 when the contract ends up at $80. 20% of the time we will lose $10 when the contract ends up at $90. 20% of the time we will break even when the contract ends up at $100. 20% of the time we will make $10 when the contract ends up at $110. And 20% of the time we will make $20 when the contract ends up at $120. We can write the arithmetic: (20% x $20) (20% x $10) +(20% x 0) +(20% x $10) +(20% x $20) = 0 Since the profits and losses exactly offset each other, the expected return to the long position is zero. The same reasoning will show that the expected return to a short position taken at the current price of $100 is also zero. Given the prices and prob- abilities, if we take either a long or short position we can expect to just break even in the long run. Now suppose that we take a long position in a $100 call. Forgetting for a moment about what we might pay for the call, what will be the expected return given the prices and probabilities in Figure 3-1? If the underlying contract finishes at $80, $90, or $100 the call will expire worthless. If the underlying contract finishes at $110 or $120 the call will be worth $10 and $20, respectively. The arithmetic is: (20% x 0) +(20% x 0} +(20% x 0) +(20% x $10) +(20% x $20) = +$6 Figure 3-1 $80 $90 $100 $110 $120 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 2. Two interesting articles discuss these limitations: Figlewski, Stephen; \u201cWhat Does an Option Pricing Model Tell Us about Option Prices?,\u201d Financial Analysts Journal, September/October 1989, pages 12-15. Black, Fischer; \u201cLiving Up to the Model,\u201d Risk, Vol. 3, No. 3., March 1990, pages 11-13. Introduction to Theoretical Pricing Models 41 The call can never be worth less than zero, so the expected return from the call position is always a non-negative number, in this case $6. If we want to develop a theoretical pricing model using this approach, we might propose a series of possible prices and probabilities for the underlying contract at expiration. Then, given an exercise price, we can calculate the value of the option at each price outcome, multiply the value by its associated probability, add up all these numbers, and thereby obtain an expected return for the option. In the foregoing example we took a very simple situation with only five possible price outcomes, each with identical probability. What changes might we make in order to develop a more realistic model? For one thing, we would have to know the settlement procedure for the option. In the United States, all options are subject to stock-type settlement, which requires full payment for the option. If the $100 call will have an expected return of $6 at expiration, we will have to deduct the carrying costs to get its value today.
