The simplest relationship is based on a constant cost of carry. The current spread of .45 (49.85 - 49.40) between the May and July futures months ts based on this relationship, since: 56/365 x 6% x 49.40 = .45 If the spread were based only on cost of carry, and interest rates remained constant at 6%, July futures would always be .92% (56/365 x 6%) greater than May futures. Unfortunately, many markets, particularly in energy and agricultural products, are subject to supply and demand forces which often distort the cost of carry relationship between futures months. For this reason, traders often choose to assume a fixed spread relationship when analyzing option positions in several different futures months. In our example, we will make the assumption that the spread between May and July futures is always .45. We have also added the assumption that July futures will be slightly more volatile (16%) than May futures (15%). Even though these volatility assumptions seem to be slightly higher than the implied volatilities in the marketplace, the trader\u2019s volatility relationship between May and July is consistent with the marketplace\u2019s opinion where the July implied volatility seems to be slightly higher than the May implied volatility. Figures 17-64 through 1 7-6f show the current characteristics of the position, as well as the characteristics under different time and volatility assumptions. At the current underlying price (May futures = 49.40, July futures = 49.85), the passage of time or any decline in volatility will hurt the position (negative theta, positive vega}. But if the underlying market should either decline or rise several points, the passage of time will begin to help the position (Figure 17-6a). Even though the theta may become positive with a move of several points, the vega of this position always remains positive (Figure 17-6b}. Regardless of underlying price, any increase (decline) in volatility will help (hurt} the position. The position acts like a long straddle with the underlying close to 50, but it acts like a long time spread with the underlying close to 46 or 53. This is typical of how difficult it can sometimes be to classify complex positions. If the position is large enough, even small changes in market conditions can cause the position to change its characteristics radically. Note that if one were to look only at the delta and gamma, it might seem that the best thing which could happen to this trader would be a swift",
