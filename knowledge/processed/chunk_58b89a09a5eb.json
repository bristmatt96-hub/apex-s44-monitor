It is also interesting to consider that most pivots on one time frame mark signi\ufb01cant market structures on lower time frames, but this is a complication that we will save for later. As a stand-alone concept, \ufb01rst-order pivot highs and lows have limited utility; their power comes from their relationship to other pivots and their ability to de\ufb01ne market structure. They are like a single brick in a building\u2014not that interesting or useful by itself. Second-order pivot highs (also called intermediate-term pivots) are \ufb01rst-order pivot highs that are preceded and followed by lower \ufb01rst-order pivot highs; again, this structure is inverted for second-order pivot lows. In Figure 1.4, notice that these second-order pivots begin to de\ufb01ne some more signi\ufb01cant structural points. It is much more likely that second-order pivots will come at important turning points, but remember that there is no predictive power because this is a pattern that is de\ufb01ned post hoc.

It is also worth noting that there is no law that says second-order pivot highs and lows have to alternate; it is possible to have three second-order pivot highs or lows in a row. If you are going to use this concept systematically, make sure your rules plan for this situation. Predictably, this concept can be extended on many levels, but in actual practice, most of our focus is on third-order pivots, which usually mark major in\ufb02ections (see Figure 1.5). Almost without exception, a trader who could identify these third-order pivots in advance would have nearly perfect entries on both sides of the market. This cannot be done, but it does point out that these third-order pivots delineate the mar- ket structure very clearly. It is worth your time to train your eye to see these pivots quickly; the value in this structure is in providing context for the market\u2019s movements. Once you understand the basic ideas behind this concept, it is probably a good idea to not be too rigid with these structures and de\ufb01nitions. If you see something on a chart that is ful\ufb01lling the basic role of one of these structures but for one reason or another does not exactly \ufb01t the criteria, it often makes sense to bend the rules for that case. The goal is to de\ufb01ne meaningful market structure, not to blindly follow a set of rules. @S(D) - Daily Soybeans Continuous Contract [Jul11] t 1,152 1,088 Oct '11 5 This PDF file is part of the audiobook THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and cannot be sold separately.

This is a problem with all swing or wave methods: they offer fantastic explanations of past mar- ket action, but have little or no predictive power at the right edge. This pivot structure is not intended to be a trading methodology; it is context. For instance, a sharp down move might be interpreted differently if it comes at a point where the market had been mak- ing consistently higher second-order pivot highs and lows compared to an environment where they were more randomly distributed. As another example, a movement that pen- etrates a signi\ufb01cant third-order pivot high or low can sometimes signi\ufb01cantly change the market environment. The purpose of this tool is to provide that structure and context, not actual trade entries. Length of Swing Once we have de\ufb01ned the second- or third-order pivot structure of the market, we can connect the pivot highs and lows with lines to outline the swing structure of the market.

If this type of analysis is new to you, it is probably a good idea to draw the structure on a few hundred charts until it becomes somewhat intuitive; eventually you want to be able to glance at a chart and see this structure immediately. Like everything else, it gets easier only with continued practice and familiarity. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this skill. Once the individual swings are delineated, we can start to consider what the market structure actually tells us about the balance of buying and selling pressure in the market. The core concepts are simple: r When buyers are stronger than sellers, upswings will be longer, both in price and",
