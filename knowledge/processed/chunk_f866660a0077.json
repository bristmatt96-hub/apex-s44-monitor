Note that even though this appears to be a catastrophic pattern failure, the actual loss on the trade should have been very small against the lowered trailing stop. This is a common pullback failure pattern, and a good reminder of the importance of moving stops. Trade management does not necessarily mean executing\u2014everyone un- derstands the idea of reducing position sizes to limit risk, but sometimes simply moving a stop is the right answer. Remember, your job as a swing trader is to take money out of the cleanest single-leg moves in the market. Never let a trade that is working turn into a full-sized loss.

In general, it is dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd spots to short market leaders, so only the best and clearest trades are appropri- ate. A strong sell-off going into May broke the established pattern of the trend, putting with-trend traders on notice and giving countertrend traders warning to start watching for potential entries. This is an important and often overlooked aspect of countertrend trades: you must have some reason, some justi\ufb01cation for even considering a coun- tertrend trade, and the best justi\ufb01cation is price action that shows a distinct change of character. Entry The actual entry was on the day that pressed to a new high and immediately reversed, closing strongly lower. There is a trade-off between trade location and con\ufb01r- mation here. While an astute intraday trader may have been able to position somewhere near the high of the day, a trader doing so as a matter of course will unavoidably have many losing trades that reverse and take out the highs. A trader waiting for the close will give up signi\ufb01cant price movement in return for the con\ufb01rmation. Either plan will work if it is applied with discipline.

Many traders will place the stop outside the previous trend extreme, but this can result in considerable slippage. Placing the stop inside the previous extreme will result in a rare stop-out where the trade is still valid, but the reduced slippage on nearly all exits will more than compensate. FIGURE 10.20 A Best-Case Failure Test Outcome The chart in Figure 10.20 is an example of practically the best possible outcome from a trade like this. First (1\u00d7) pro\ufb01t targets would have been hit early on, and in this case, the failure test actually marked the extreme high point of the trend. A: After a strong downthrust, a small consolidation like this often points to more downside\u2014you can enter new positions here, add to existing positions, or just use the pattern as a reference to manage existing exposure. B: Even if you do not choose to trade pullbacks, they are the fundamental structure of trends, and being able to read price action around pullbacks will give you great insight into the integrity of the trend. Many traders would have covered much of their trade by this point, but seeing small consolidations break down cleanly could give you justi\ufb01cation for holding part of the trade. C: Continuing with that theme, when you see these patterns not break down as cleanly or easily, it is a sign that something has shifted and the easy money in the trade is probably over.

It is absolutely essential to maintain the discipline of taking partial pro\ufb01ts at the 1\u00d7 target, because many of these trades will quickly reverse and continue the original trend. In addition, it probably makes sense to do these failure test trades on smaller risk for two reasons: stops tend to be very tight, often less than a single day\u2019s range, and there is increased danger of catastrophic gap failure through the old trend extreme. Failure Test, Second-Day Entry FIGURE 10.21 A Second-Day Failure Test Entry Setup The S&P 500 index, shown in Figure 10.21, had been in a yearlong uptrend and was showing signs of possible overextension on higher time frames. There was no strong down move setting up this countertrend trade, but there were multiple momentum di- vergences and failures on lower time frames that set up the possibility of a successful fade trade. Entry A: The actual entry is slightly more complex in this case. This bar presses to new highs and closes slightly above the previous resistance level. The next day trades high, then reverses to close under the old highs. Entry",
