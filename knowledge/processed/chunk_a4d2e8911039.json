  "content": "if we recall one of the characteristics of option evaluation introduced in Chapter 6: If we consider three options, an in-the-money, at-the-money, and out-of: the-money option which are identical except for their exercise prices, the at-the-money option is always the most sensitive in total points to a change in volatility. This means that when all options appear overpriced because we believe implied volatility is too high, in total points the at-the-money option will be the most overpriced. When all options appear underpriced because we believe implied volatility is too low, in total points the at-the-money option will be the most underpriced. This characteristic leads to a very simple rule for choosing bull and bear vertical spreads: /fimplied volatility is too low, vertical spreads should focus on purchasing the at-the-money option. If implied volatility is too high, vertical spreads should focus on selling the at-the-money options. Now we can see why the 100/105 call spread is a better value if implied volatility is 16%, while the 95/100 spread is a better value if implied volatility is 24%. If implied volatility is too low (16%), we want to buy the at-the-money (100) call. Having done this, we have only one choice in order to create a bull spread\u2014sell the out-of-the-money (105) call. If implied volatility is too high (24%), we want to sell the at-the- money (100) call. Having done this, we again have only one choice in order to create a bull spread\u2014buy the in-the-money (95) call. The same principle is equally true for put vertical spreads. We always want to focus on the at-the-money option, buying it when implied volatility is too low, and selling it when implied volatility is too high. For example, suppose we want to do a bear put spread with implied volatility too low. In this case we want to buy the at-the-money (100) put. Having done this, we are forced to sell the out-of-the-money (95) put to create our bear spread. We can see from Figure 10-5 that we will pay approximately 1.90 for this spread, but the spread is worth 2.04. We will end up with a delta position of -20, and a positive theoretical edge of .14. Of course, a trader is not required to execute any vertical spread by first buying or selling the at-the-money option. Such spreads always involve two options, and a trader can choose to either execute the complete spread in one transaction, or leg into the spread by trading one option at a time. In the latter case, he may decide to first trade the in-the-money or out-of-the-money option, and trade the at-the-money option at a later time. This is a practical trading decision he will have to make based on market conditions and the amount of risk he is willing to accept. Regardless of how the spread is executed, the trader should focus on the at-the-money option, either buying it when implied volatility is too low, or selling it when implied volatility is too high. In practice itis unlikely that one option will be exactly at-the-money, so that it may be difficult to decide which option to buy and which to sell. In such a case, it is usually Bull and Bear Spreads 209 best to focus on the option which is closest to at-the-money. If the underlying market is at 103, with 95, 100, 105, and 110 calls available, it is logical to focus on the 105 call since it is closest to at-the-money. If implied volatility is too low, a trader will want to buy the 105 call; if implied volatility is too high, a trader will want to sell the 105 call. He can then trade a different option in order to create a bull or bear vertical spread. Nor does a trader have to include the option which is closest-to-the-money as part of his spread. A trader who has a strong directional opinion can choose a vertical spread where both options are very far out-of-the-money or very deeply in-the-money. The delta values of such spreads will be very low, but a trader can create a highly leveraged position by executing each spread many times. For example, with the underlying market at 100, a trader who is strongly bullish might buy the 115/120 call spread (assuming such exercise prices are available}. The cost of this spread will be very low since there is a high probability that the spread will expire worthless. Hence, the trader will be able to execute the spread many times at a relatively low cost. If he is right and the market does rise above 120, the spread will widen to its maximum value of five points, resulting in very large profits. But regardless of the exercise prices chosen, if implied volatility is low, the trader will attempt to buy the closer-to-the-money option, and if implied volatility is high, the trader will attempt to sell the closer-to-the-money option. The choice of the at-the-money option is slightly different when we move to stock options. If we define the at-the-money option as the one whose delta is closest to 50, then we may find that the at-the-money option is not always the one whose exercise price is closest to the current price of the underlying contract. This is because the option with a delta closest to 50 will be the one whose exercise price is closest to the forward price of the underlying contract. In stock options, the forward price is the current price of the stock, plus carrying costs on the stock, less expected dividends. Assuming an underlying stock price of 99, six months to expiration, a volatility of 28%, interest rates of 10%, and no dividend, we can see from Figure 10-6 that the 105 call has a delta of 50 and therefore acts like the at-the-money option, even though its exercise price is six points higher than the current underlying price. Therefore, any vertical spread should focus on the 105 call or 105 put. The approximate prices of vertical",
