Am I di gg in g ? Am I so cau g ht up and fused with what my mind is tellin g me that I am living out of past memories and projections of the future missing the richness of the present and all the opportunities it o ff ers? Am I di gg in g ? Because of the wa y in which the mind works, most readers will fi nd it diffi cul t to remember to ask themselves, \u201cAm I digging?\u201d W e need a little help. There are a number of ways we can remind ourselves. Write down, \u201cAm I di gg in g ?\u201d on an index card and keep it near your tradin g desk. Use a post\u2010it note and post alon g side your monitor where you will see it frequently during the day , \u201cAm I digging?\u201d Have a section in your daily journal and call it, \u201cWhat did I di g today?\u201d Write a sentence or two each ni g ht about your di g s as you review the day . Buy a sheet of dots or squares that have adhesive on the backside from a stationary store and stick these in di ff eren t places you frequent to remind you about di gg in g . Good places to stick these are on your coff ee mu g , on the bathroom mirror, on your computer screen, and on any - thing you are likely to see during the course of your day . If you work with others in a tradin g fi rm, this is a way to maintain your privacy while still havin g reminders avail - able. However you do it, g et into the habit of askin g yourself, \u201cAm I di gg in g ?\u201d After a while, you will begin to catch yourself when struggling or when fused and you will hear yourself say , \u201cWhoops, I\u2019m di gg in g .\u201d This will serve as an automatic, personal si g na l to step b ac k an d h o ld your t h ou gh ts an d f ee l in g s at more o f a d istance, an d to refocus your attention back to the present and onto the tradin g task at hand. \u25a0 Note 1.

Wilson, Acceptance and Commitment Therap y: An Experiential Approach to Behavior Change ( New Y ork: Guilford Press, 1999 ) , 101\u2013104. 171 CHAPTER 8 Acceptance and Committed Trading p I t is universal truth that all traders experience stress alon g with unwanted emo- t ions and thoughts sometimes in their trading life. No one is completely free from this. Tradin g will always have moments of pain. There will always be mistakes made, missed opportunities, losin g trades, down days, and even slumps for protracted peri- ods. There will always be adversity in trading because trading is a game of probabili- ties. Any g iven trade has a probability of a win and also a probability of a loss. Losses are, therefore, a certainty in tradin g . No one likes losses. There are obvious fi nancial consequences when we su ff er losses, and there are also psycholo g ical consequences associated with losses, that is, pain and stress. Hence it is only natural that we do not like losses. But interestin g enough, it is not the pain and stress themselves but the struggle we have with the pain and stress that actually causes tradin g problems. This is of vital importance for traders to understand. Let\u2019s be ver y clear: It is not stress itsel f that causes tradin g diffi culties, but our rejection of stress and fi ghting it that creates trading problems . As we have seen earlier, workin g to escape, control, mana g e, or g et rid of unwanted emotions an d t h ou gh ts ta k es our f ocus an d attention away f rom our tra d in g tas k s, t h us causin g tradin g problems. And, it is not just tradin g problems, but problems in life as well. Psycholo g ist Steven Hayes and his collea g ues assert that psycholo g ical disturbances are primari l y b rou gh t a b out b y t h e stru ggl e wit h unwante d t h ou gh ts an d emotions. Stress is often mali g ned as a scape g oat. It is viewed as a force that impacts ne g a- tivel y our life, health, work, and relationships. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have such stress, I would tra d e b etter \u201d ; \u201c I f I d i d n \u2019 t h ave stress, I wou ld b e h ea l t h ier. \u201d Suc h b e l ie f s natura lly l ea d to the eff orts of stru gg lin g with stress and tryin g to g et rid of it. 30 This PDF file is part of the audiobook TRADE MINDFULLY and cannot be sold separately.
