This is a good lesson\u2014all of these patterns are essentially the same pattern . A very important structural element in swing analysis is the \ufb01rst downswing in an uptrend that is longer than the preceding upswing (see Figure 3.33). Vertically, this swing will make a lower low, setting up a potential trend change condition, but it is even more important to realize that this swing can indicate a distinct change of character in the market. It usually shows a failure on the part of the buyers to support the market, and, depending on the strength of the selling pressure in the swing (which must be judged from price action or lower time frame market structure), it may even set up a potential countertrend short on the next bounce. This is perhaps the single most important pattern in length of swing analysis. Of course, it is not always so simple. Though we might expect a shortable bounce following the pattern in Figure 3.33, it is also possible that this type of downswing may simply set up a complex consolidation. Furthermore, though a complex consolidation is usually a trend continuation pattern, there are other possible resolutions that may follow that pattern. Any of the possible pullback failure patterns apply equally well to complex consolidations because they are simple pullbacks on the higher time frame. These examples have dealt exclusively with uptrends, but they are simply re\ufb02ected and reversed for downtrends. These patterns can form a foundation for a robust under- standing of trend analysis. Do not be put off by the simplicity of this analysis. In the right context, simple tools work very well. Using Trend Lines to De\ufb01ne Rate of Trend Trend lines are one of the most used and abused tools in modern technical analysis. One good working de\ufb01nition of a trend line is a line drawn between two points on a chart, but then",
