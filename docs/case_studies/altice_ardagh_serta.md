# LME Case Studies: Lessons for European HY

## 1. Altice France - The European LME Blueprint

### Background
- **Company:** Altice France (French telecom)
- **Sponsor:** Patrick Drahi / Altice Group
- **Peak Debt:** ~€24bn
- **Timeline:** 2023-2024 restructuring

### What Happened

**Phase 1: Value Extraction (Pre-Distress)**
- Years of dividend recaps to parent despite high leverage
- Complex corporate structure with multiple entities
- Asset transfers between Altice entities
- Loose documentation permitted significant flexibility

**Phase 2: LME Execution**
- Hired restructuring advisors (Lazard, Rothschild)
- Segregated creditor groups formed
- Multiple tranches treated differently
- Drop-down of valuable assets (data centers, towers)
- Selective liability management favoring some creditors

**Phase 3: Creditor Response**
- Ad hoc groups formed
- Litigation initiated
- Some creditors signed cooperation agreements
- Others left holding impaired claims

### Documentation Weaknesses Exploited
1. **Unrestricted Subsidiary Capacity**
   - Valuable assets (data centers, fiber) moved outside restricted group
   - No J.Crew blocker on key assets

2. **Permitted Investment Baskets**
   - Large baskets allowed intercompany value transfer
   - Grower provisions expanded capacity

3. **Restricted Payment History**
   - Significant dividends paid during better times
   - Built-up capacity used for sponsor payments

4. **Complex Structure**
   - Multiple holdcos and borrowing entities
   - Structural subordination risk
   - Unclear asset ownership

### Lessons for XO S44 Portfolio
- **Watch for:** Complex telecom structures, sponsor dividend history, large permitted baskets
- **Red flags:** Intercompany reorganizations, asset transfers, advisor appointments
- **Similar names:** Any PE-backed telecom/cable with high leverage

### CDS Implications
- Restructuring Credit Event ultimately triggered
- Multiple DC deliberations
- Complex successor/deliverable analysis
- Auction held with significant basis

## 2. Ardagh Group - Glass Houses Shatter

### Background
- **Company:** Ardagh Group (glass/metal packaging)
- **Structure:** Ardagh Group SA (parent), multiple issuing entities
- **Peak Debt:** ~$12bn across entities
- **Timeline:** 2023-2025 ongoing stress

### What Happened

**The Setup:**
- Aggressive acquisition strategy (Verallia spin, metal packaging)
- Multiple debt silos at different entities
- Parent company vs operating company complexity
- ZIRP-era documentation with weak protections

**The Unraveling:**
1. Operating performance deteriorated (energy costs, volume declines)
2. Parent company (Ardagh Group SA) structurally subordinated
3. Operating company (Ardagh Packaging) better positioned
4. Creditor value highly dependent on which entity's debt held

**LME Tactics Observed:**
- Intercompany transactions between entities
- Selective debt buybacks at discount
- Potential asset sales to service one silo vs another
- Creditor groups forming at different levels

### Documentation Weaknesses
1. **Structural Subordination**
   - Parent company debt subordinated to opco debt
   - No cross-guarantees protecting parent holders
   - Value resides at operating subsidiaries

2. **Intercompany Flexibility**
   - Loose restrictions on intercompany loans
   - Parent could support one sub over another

3. **Complexity by Design**
   - Multiple issuing entities created optionality
   - Different covenant packages at different levels
   - Arbitrage between creditor groups

### Lessons for XO S44 Portfolio
- **Watch for:** Multi-entity structures, parent vs opco debt, structural subordination
- **Red flags:** Divergent trading levels between tranches, intercompany activity
- **Similar names:** Complex industrial holdcos, PE roll-ups

### CDS Implications
- Reference Entity matters enormously (parent vs opco)
- Successor determinations if restructuring
- Different outcomes for different CDS contracts
- Basis between tranches created CDS arbitrage

## 3. Serta Simmons - The Up-Tier Playbook

### Background
- **Company:** Serta Simmons Bedding (US mattress manufacturer)
- **Sponsor:** Advent International
- **Debt:** ~$2.4bn
- **Timeline:** 2020 up-tier, 2023 bankruptcy

### What Happened

**The Up-Tier Transaction (2020):**
1. Company facing liquidity crisis
2. Subset of lenders (~51%) agreed to exchange into new super-priority debt
3. Non-participating lenders (~49%) left holding subordinated claims
4. Participating lenders received:
   - New first-out super-priority term loan
   - Better pricing and collateral position
5. Non-participating lenders received:
   - Nothing - remained in original (now second-out) debt
   - Effectively primed without consent

**Documentation Exploited:**
- "Open market purchase" provision allowed selective buyback
- Amendment threshold not 100% for lien priority
- No explicit "sacred right" for pro rata treatment
- Ability to incur priming debt under permitted baskets

### The Litigation
- Non-participating lenders sued
- Key arguments:
  - Breach of implied covenant of good faith
  - Violation of pro rata sharing
  - Sacred rights violated
- Courts initially split, some rulings for lenders
- Ultimately company filed Chapter 11 (2023)

### Outcome
- Participating lenders recovered significantly more
- Non-participating lenders received minimal recovery
- Litigation settlement in bankruptcy
- Precedent set for future up-tiers (both enabling and defensive)

### Lessons for XO S44 Portfolio
1. **Amendment Thresholds Matter**
   - If lien subordination isn't 100% consent, you're at risk
   - "Sacred rights" language is critical

2. **Creditor Coordination**
   - Early coordination essential
   - Being outside the group is devastating
   - Sign cooperation agreements early

3. **Open Market Purchase Loophole**
   - Allows selective treatment
   - Check for this language

4. **Post-Serta Documentation**
   - Better docs now include "anti-Serta" provisions
   - Check vintage of documentation

### CDS Implications
- Up-tier itself did NOT trigger Restructuring Credit Event
- Original loan terms technically unchanged
- Credit Event only on eventual bankruptcy
- Gap between bond loss and CDS trigger

## 4. Other Notable Cases (Brief)

### J.Crew (2017) - The Original Drop-Down
- Transferred valuable brand IP to unrestricted subsidiary
- Raised new debt secured by IP
- Existing bondholders left with depleted collateral
- Led to "J.Crew blocker" language in better docs

### Revlon (2020) - The Accidental Payment
- Citibank accidentally paid off $900m loan
- Lenders refused to return money
- Showed how tight liquidity creates errors
- Illustrates operational risk in distress

### Envision Healthcare (2023) - Double-Dip
- Used intercompany loan structure
- New lenders got claims at multiple levels
- Existing creditors structurally subordinated
- Complex healthcare/PE structure

### Incora (2024) - European Follow-On
- Aviation parts business
- European HY issuer
- Used similar tactics to US precedents
- Shows Europe adopting US LME playbook
