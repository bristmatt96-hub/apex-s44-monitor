# Ardagh CDS Deliverables Dispute: Arini vs Tresidor

## Case Status: ACTIVE (Jan 2026)
**Forum**: EMEA Determinations Committee
**Instruments**: Senior Unsecured Notes (SUNs)
**Stakes**: Whether SUNs qualify as deliverable obligations into CDS auction

---

## The Combatants

| Party | Position | Backing |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Arini Capital Management** | EXCLUDE SUNs from deliverables | Protection sellers |
| **Tresidor Investment Management** | INCLUDE SUNs in deliverables | Protection buyers (with Laurion) |

---

## The Core Dispute

### Arini's Argument (Exclusion)
> "SUNs should be struck from deliverable obligations because their outstanding principal balance (OPB) was already **ZERO** when the restructuring credit event was triggered."

**Theory**: The TSA and consent solicitation on September 29, 2025 bound SUN holders to equitization. Therefore, by the time the credit event was determined, there was no principal left to deliver.

### Tresidor's Counter (Inclusion)
> "Arini's challenge contains **multiple logical non-sequiturs** and quotes **selectively** from the external review panel decision."

**Theory**: Article IV (credit events) and Article III (deliverables) are **separate** parts of the ISDA architecture. The panel ruled on *timing*, not *deliverability*.

---

## The Technical ISDA Framework

### Article IV vs Article III Distinction

| Article | Governs | Question Answered |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Article IV** | Credit Events | WHEN did the credit event occur? |
| **Article III** | Deliverable Obligations & OPB | WHAT can be delivered into auction? |

**Tresidor's Key Point**: The external review panel was asked a "narrow question of **when** a restructuring credit event occurred" - NOT whether SUNs had OPB for settlement purposes.

> "The decision covered the timing of a credit event under Article IV, and not a determination of an OPB under Article III."

---

## The Schrödinger's Obligation Paradox

**The Problem**: Can the SUNs coherently be treated as:
1. **Bound to equitization** for credit-event purposes (Arini's reading)
2. **Still outstanding** for settlement purposes (Tresidor's reading)

### Arini's View
This creates an incoherent paradox - the same instrument cannot be both extinguished and outstanding.

### Tresidor's View
This is a **feature, not a bug**. Credit events can occur in advance of final outcomes, while OPB concerns whether claims have **in fact** been compromised as of the event determination date.

> "Credit events and the definition of OPB play different roles in the ISDA architecture."

---

## The CAC (Collective Action Clause) Argument

### Arini's Position
CACs in the SUN indentures meant the notes were already subject to a binding reduction in principal, rendering them contingent and non-deliverable.

### Tresidor's Rebuttal
CACs are **"amendment machinery, not self-executing principal-reducing provisions."**

> "The restructuring was driven by external factors (the TSA and Consent Solicitation Agreement) that were not 'pursuant to the terms of the obligation[s]' of the SUNs."

**Key Point**: If principal reduction flowed from the terms of the obligation alone, the TSA and consent solicitation would not have been necessary.

### The Slippery Slope Warning
Tresidor warns against expanding "terms of the obligation" to include TSAs and interim agreements:

> "Such an approach would make the determination of OPB 'practically unworkable', forcing the DC into open-ended factual inquiries about every external influence that might one day lead to a principal reduction."

---

## The Permitted Contingency Defense

### ISDA Section 3.11(b)
Reductions in OPB arising from actions **"within the control of the holders of the obligation or a third party acting on their behalf"** are explicitly **excluded** from calculation.

### Application to Ardagh
- SUN holders **led, negotiated, and agreed** the restructuring
- TSA and consent solicitation were mechanisms for holders to exercise their rights
- Therefore, any principal changes from collective voting should be **ignored** when determining OPB

---

## The Counterfactual Argument

### Tresidor's Hypothetical
If Ardagh had entered insolvency **before** the supplemental indenture was executed in November 2025:
- The TSA would have **terminated**
- The SUNs would have remained **valid claims** for their **full face value**

**Conclusion**: This possibility is incompatible with Arini's claim that principal had already been reduced to zero on September 29.

### External Review Panel Finding
> "An agreement can exist prior to implementation... a restructuring credit event can occur even where the restructuring might never be implemented."

---

## Settlement Mechanics: Asset Package Delivery

### Tresidor's Position
- Delivering post-reorganization instruments is **allowed** under established European practice
- Necessary to achieve a **representative auction**
- The CDS contract "was designed to payout in these situations"

### Warning on Precedent
> "To deny that flexibility in a restructuring context would create artificial distinctions between bankruptcy and restructuring credit events and risk producing outcomes that fail to reflect the economic reality experienced by creditors."

---

## Market Implications

### If Arini Wins (SUNs Excluded)
- Protection **sellers** win
- Auction recovery artificially **high** (only secured bonds deliverable)
- CDS fails to hedge restructuring loss on unsecured

### If Tresidor Wins (SUNs Included)
- Protection **buyers** win
- Auction recovery reflects **true impairment**
- CDS functions as intended hedge

### Precedent Impact
This case will define how **Article III vs Article IV** interact in future restructurings. A ruling for Arini could:
- Encourage restructuring structures that accelerate "agreement" timing
- Create asymmetry between bankruptcy and restructuring credit events
- Undermine CDS as restructuring hedge

## Lessons for Other Credits

### Red Flags This Case Highlights

1. **Complex holdco structures** create reference entity uncertainty
2. **TSA timing** can be weaponized to affect credit event determination
3. **Consent solicitations** may trigger Article IV vs III disputes
4. **Multi-entity issuers** (Ardagh Group, ARD Finance, AMP) create confusion
5. **Historical dividend recaps** suggest aggressive financial engineering

### Questions to Ask on New Credits

1. What is the **reference entity** for CDS? Holdco or OpCo?
2. Do indentures contain **CACs** that could trigger early "agreement"?
3. Is there **structural subordination** that creates deliverables complexity?
4. Has sponsor/founder historically been **aggressive** on financial engineering?
5. What **interim agreements** (TSAs, lock-ups) could affect credit event timing?
