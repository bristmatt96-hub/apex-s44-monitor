# Liability Management Exercise (LME) Tactics

## Overview

LMEs are transactions where borrowers restructure debt outside of formal bankruptcy, often at the expense of existing creditors. ZIRP-era covenant-lite documentation enabled aggressive tactics that exploit loopholes.

## Common LME Tactics

### 1. Drop-Down Transactions (J.Crew / Chewy)

**Mechanism:** Transfer valuable assets to an unrestricted subsidiary outside the credit group, then raise new debt at that subsidiary with priority claim on those assets.

**Documentation Exploited:**
- Unrestricted subsidiary designation rights
- Permitted investment baskets
- Limited asset sale covenants

**Red Flags:**
- Large "Permitted Investments" basket
- Ability to designate subsidiaries as "Unrestricted"
- No limitations on IP transfers
- Grower baskets tied to EBITDA/assets

**Case Studies:** J.Crew (2017), Chewy, Revlon

---

### 2. Up-Tier Exchange (Serta / Trimark)

**Mechanism:** Existing lenders form a group to exchange into new super-priority debt, subordinating non-participating lenders who remain in the original debt.

**Documentation Exploited:**
- "Open market purchase" provisions allowing selective buybacks
- Amendment provisions not requiring unanimous consent for lien subordination
- Ability to incur priming debt

**Red Flags:**
- Amendment threshold below 100% for lien priority changes
- Broad "open market purchase" language
- Permitted debt baskets allowing priming
- No "sacred rights" protection for lien priority

**Case Studies:** Serta Simmons (2020), Trimark, Boardrider

---

### 3. Double-Dip / Intercompany Loan

**Mechanism:** Create intercompany loans from restricted subsidiaries to unrestricted subsidiaries, effectively giving new lenders multiple claims (direct + intercompany guarantee).

**Documentation Exploited:**
- Permitted intercompany loan provisions
- Lack of structural subordination protections

**Red Flags:**
- Broad intercompany loan baskets
- No restrictions on guarantees to unrestricted subs
- Complex multi-entity structures

**Case Studies:** Envision Healthcare

### 4. Asset Stripping / Collateral Leakage

**Mechanism:** Gradually transfer valuable assets outside the restricted group through permitted baskets, leaving bondholders with depleted collateral.

**Documentation Exploited:**
- Cumulative restricted payment capacity
- Asset sale proceeds reinvestment exceptions
- Builder baskets

**Red Flags:**
- Large RP capacity (especially "grower" baskets)
- Loose asset sale covenant with reinvestment rights
- Unlimited intercompany transfers
- High "Available Amount" builder basket

**Case Studies:** Altice France, PetSmart

---

### 5. Pari Passu Debt Incurrence (Priming)

**Mechanism:** Issue new debt with equal or better claim on collateral than existing debt, diluting recovery for original creditors.

**Documentation Exploited:**
- Ratio-based debt incurrence tests
- Permitted debt baskets without lien restrictions
- First Lien/First Out vs First Lien/Second Out ambiguity

**Red Flags:**
- Large "Permitted Debt" baskets
- Ratio debt incurrence at low thresholds
- No cap on pari debt
- 1L/1O vs 1L/2O structure confusion

---

### 6. Liability Management Cooperation Agreement (LMCA)

**Mechanism:** Creditor group signs cooperation agreement to act collectively in LME, potentially at expense of non-signatories.

**Warning Signs:**
- News of ad hoc creditor groups forming
- Advisors hired by creditor groups (not company)
- Selective disclosure to certain holders
