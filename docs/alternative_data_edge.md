# Alternative Data Edge

## The Reality
Bloomberg/Refinitiv = everyone has it = no edge
Debtwire/9fin = most HY investors have it = limited edge

**Real edge comes from:**
1. Sources others aren't monitoring
2. Processing public info faster/better
3. Connecting dots others miss
4. Network intelligence

## FREE Sources With Edge Potential

### 1. Court Filings (HUGE edge)

**UK Courts (free)**
- https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service
- Companies Court: Scheme applications, winding up petitions
- Search by company name

**What to look for:**
- Scheme of Arrangement applications → LME confirmed
- Winding up petitions → Creditor action
- Administration applications → Insolvency
- Charge registrations → New security

**Edge:** Most investors don't monitor daily. Court filing = hours before news wire.

---

**Netherlands (WHOA/Bankruptcy)**
- https://www.rechtspraak.nl/
- WHOA filings becoming common for European HY

**Edge:** WHOA filing = restructuring confirmed. Usually 1-2 days before market knows.

---

**US PACER (if relevant)**
- https://pacer.uscourts.gov/
- Chapter 11 filings, adversary proceedings
- $0.10/page but worth it

---

### 2. Company Registries (free)

**UK Companies House**
- https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/

### 3. Job Postings (Underrated)

**LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor**

|-------------|--------|
| "Restructuring" in finance role | LME coming |

| Mass layoffs appearing | Operational distress |
| Hiring freeze visible | Cash preservation |
| Advisor firm hiring for specific sector | Mandates coming |

**Monitor:**
