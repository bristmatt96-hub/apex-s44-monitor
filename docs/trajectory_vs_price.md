# Credit Trajectory vs Price Framework

## The Core Question

> "Is the credit getting better or worse, and has the market priced it?"

| Trajectory | Price | Opportunity |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Improving | Still cheap | **BUY** - market hasn't caught up |
| Improving | Already expensive | HOLD - priced in |
| Deteriorating | Still expensive | **SELL/SHORT** - market in denial |
| Deteriorating | Already cheap | HOLD - priced in, wait for catalyst |

## Trajectory Scoring System

### Fundamental Trajectory Score (-10 to +10)

**Positive Signals (+1 to +3 each):**
| Signal | Points | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| EBITDA growing QoQ | +2 | Improving margins |
| Leverage declining | +2 | Deleveraging path |
| FCF positive/improving | +2 | Cash generation |
| Rating upgrade/outlook positive | +2 | Moody's upgrades |
| Successful refinancing | +1 | Maturity extended |
| Asset sale at good price | +1 | Deleveraging catalyst |
| New equity injection | +3 | Sponsor support |
| Industry tailwinds | +1 | Sector recovery |

**Negative Signals (-1 to -3 each):**
| Signal | Points | Example |
|--------|--------| --------|
| EBITDA declining QoQ | -2 | Margin compression |
| Leverage increasing | -2 | Debt growing faster than EBITDA |
| FCF negative/worsening | -2 | Cash burn |
| Rating downgrade/outlook negative | -2 | S&P cuts |
| Maturity wall approaching | -1 | Near-term refinancing risk |
| Forced asset sale | -1 | Fire sale |
| Dividend to sponsor despite stress | -2 | Value extraction |
| Industry headwinds | -1 | Sector downturn |
| Advisor hired | -3 | LME imminent |
| "Evaluating options" language | -3 | Restructuring likely |

### Price Signal Score (-10 to +10)

**Cheap Signals (+):**
| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Bonds >10pts below 6mo avg | +3 |
| Bonds >5pts below 6mo avg | +2 |
| Yield >200bps above comp | +2 |
| Recent forced selling (CLO, ETF) | +2 |
| Low liquidity driving price | +1 |

**Expensive Signals (-):**

**BUY Zone:** Trajectory improving, price still cheap
**SHORT Zone:** Trajectory deteriorating, price still expensive  
**HOLD (priced in):** Market already reflects trajectory
**HOLD (wait):** Deteriorating but already cheap - need catalyst
