The company generates strong EBITDA ($2.35bn) and CFFO ($2.95bn). However, the auto sector faces structural challenges (EV transition, OEM pricing pressure), FCF is weak after high capex, and net income is declining. Cut FY25 sales guidance in Jul 2025. Mar 2026 maturity ($659m) needs refinancing. Active portfolio management through divestitures is positive. Distress score of 19 is elevated for a credit with such low leverage - reflects sector concerns rather than balance sheet issues.",
