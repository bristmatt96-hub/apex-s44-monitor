Distress score of 9 is the lowest in your portfolio. All bonds trading near/above par with tight yields (2.7-4.0%) reflect near-IG quality. The $8.8bn market cap provides massive equity cushion. Strong CFFO of $3.5bn demonstrates cash generation. Main risk is Mar 2026 convertible ($628m) maturity and large lease liabilities (~$10bn) which are typical for travel retail.",
