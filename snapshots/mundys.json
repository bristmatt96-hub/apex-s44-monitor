Distress score of 12 is low. However, the sheer debt quantum creates refinancing execution risk. Net leverage of 5.5x is appropriate for infrastructure but leaves limited cushion. Split credit structure (Mundys Ba1/BB+, subsidiaries IG) adds complexity. Aeroporti di Roma downgrade is a yellow flag. Edizione/Blackstone backing provides support.",
